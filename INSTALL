INSTALL for LuaTeX Snapshots

=========================================================
The snapshot code is NOT stable, it may not even compile
properly!  Features that are present today may be gone
in tomorrow. There ARE bugs. You should NOT use this
program for ANYTHING except testing!
=========================================================

This distribution is essentially a stripped-down version of 
the TeXlive distribution with some additional libraries.

All source code is in the directory src; the build.sh.xxx 
scripts will generate and populate a directory build.
 
The actual code of luaTeX is in src/texk/web2c/luatexdir
and its subdirectories.

* build.sh builds a native luatex on your system, but
  with a 'generic' lua inpreter embedded (assuming posix
  compliance).
* build.sh.linux creates luatex for linux on i386
* build.sh.cross crosscompiles luatex for mingw32 on linux

These somewhat bizarre build scripts are needed because 
Lua is not using autoconf (unlike the rest of the tree).

LuaTeX does not need a run-time pool file, and it locates
texmf.cnf based on its relative position in the TeX tree.

Post-compilation installation should be a simple matter 
of copying the executable to a normal place for web2c 
binaries and generating the desired formats.

You may want to install the executable under the names
'texlua' and 'texluac' as well (create a copy or symlink)
