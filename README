Public domain.  Originally written 2006, Karl Berry.

This Build directory contains sources and tools which are used in
building TeX Live, but are not part of the live hierarchy.  Each subdir
has another README with more details.

logs   - complete logs of all commits to the TL source repositories.
source - the actual sources for all the executable programs.
tests  - a testing infrastructure, quiescent for some years
         but left here in case it gets revived some day.

Directories named tmp.raw and tmp.cooked are also created/used/removed
here by ctan2tl, ctan2tds, and place.

If you know enough about TeX to be reading this, then you (or your
institution) should consider joining a TeX user group (there's a list at
http://tug.org/usergroups.html) -- if you're already a member, thanks
for your support!

The TeX Users Group, the oldest such group, produces the periodicals
TUGboat (http://tug.org/TUGboat), The PracTeX Journal
(http://tug.org/pracjourn), sponsors an annual meeting,
and hosts TeX Live development and distribution.
