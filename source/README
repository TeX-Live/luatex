Public domain.  Originally written 2005 by Karl Berry.

For a high-level overview of building TeX Live, see
http://tug.org/texlive/build.html.  In brief:

- To configure and make the source tree, run ./Build.
  This builds in subdirectory Work/, and installs into subdirectory inst/.

- To build (mostly) without optimization, run ./Build --debug.

- If the make fails and you want to rebuild without starting from scratch:
  cd Work/whatever/subdir && make

Email tlbuild@tug.org if problems.

(Nearly everything the Build script does can be overridden via
environment variables; just take a look to see the names.)

Many more details about the TL build system, such as configuring to work
on a single program, adding new programs or libraries, documentation
about the many pieces of the system, etc., are in the doc/tlbuild*
document and the sibling README* files here (which are generated from
that document).


Build information for some of the platforms.

x86_64-linux: Debian 6.0 (Squeeze), Feb 2009.
  
amd64-netbsd:
  gcc version 4.5.3 (NetBSD nb2 20110806)
  NetBSD/amd64 6.1.3
  TL_MAKE=gmake LDFLAGS='-L/usr/X11R7/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/X11R7/lib' ./Build
  
i386-freebsd, amd64-freebsd:
  --disable-dvisvgm; upmendex for i386 built with -DU_IS_BIG_ENDIAN=0.

i386-linux: Debian 7.

i386-openbsd, amd64-openbsd:
  e.g., see CONFIGURE_ARGS in the Makefile in
  http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/print/texlive/base/

i386-solaris, x86_64-solaris: Solaris 10.  See doc/README.solaris.

i386-cygwin, x86_64-cygwin: gcc-4.8.2, cygwin-1.7.29.
  ./Build (with --enable-xindy for i386).

powerpc-linux (Debian Squeeze):
  Linux homer 2.6.32-5-powerpc64 #1 SMP Tue Mar 8 02:01:42 UTC 2011
  ppc64 Debian GNU/Linux 6.0
  (only the kernel is 64bit, the entire userland is 32bit)

sparc-solaris: Solaris 10, gcc.  See doc/README.solaris.

x86_64-darwin:
  See Master/source/mactexdoc.tar.xz.

x86_64-darwinlegacy, i386-darwin, powerpc-darwin:
  https://github.com/TeXLive-M/texlive-buildbot
  http://build.contextgarden.net/waterfall?tag=c/texlive
  (These links have info on all platforms built by Mojca.)
  
  32-bit binaries built on 10.6/x86_64 with backward compatibility to 10.5.
  ppc binaries only work on <= 10.5, so 10.5/ppc will be the only OS for them.
  i386 binaries only work on <= 10.6. While they theoretically work
    "everywhere", they would only be used on 10.5 and 10.6/i386.
  x86_64 binaries only work on >= 10.6 (and should work on any >= 10.6 machine)
    but will only be used for < 10.10 since x86_64-darwin covers newer.
  PPC binaries made with gcc-4.2 and Intel binaries with clang-3.7.
