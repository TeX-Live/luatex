	=====================

Purpose:
--------

Testing the mechanism to configure and buid the various TL modules
	libs/*
	utils/*
	texk/*
in a different order.  If a program or library built in module A (e.g.,
texk/dvipng) depends on a library supplied by module B (e.g., libs/libpng or
texk/kpathsea) then module B is built before configuring module A.

This package demonstrates how to first configure and build each of the
libraries in the TL tree (texk/kpathsea and libs/*), before configuring
other libraries or programs using that library.

This is mainly important for modules maintained independently, outside the
TL tree.  Such modules can be configured and built as part of the TL tree or
independently using installed (system) versions of the required libraries. 
Building these required libraries before configuring the module, allows to
perform the same tests to determine features of the (uninstalled or system)
libraries.  This should considerably reduce the work required to integrate
new versions of such modules into the LT tree.

This mechanism is intended to become part of the TL build system.  It is
therefore important to test it now on all different build systems, instead
of complaining later.

=============================

Some remarks:
-------------

At the moment all (sub-)packages use Automake; that's just a lot simpler,
but translation to plain Autoconf should be straightforward.

All programs use Libtool in order to properly handle (uninstalled or system)
libtool libraries.

A few libraries use Libtool but most don't.
