tlmgr - the TeX Live Manager

@node tlmgr SYNOPSIS
@appendixsec SYNOPSIS

tlmgr [@emph{option}]... @emph{action} [@emph{option}]... [@emph{operand}]...

@node tlmgr DESCRIPTION
@appendixsec DESCRIPTION

@strong{tlmgr} manages an existing TeX Live installation, both packages and
configuration options.  For information on initially downloading and
installing TeX Live, see @url{http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html}.

The most up-to-date version of this documentation (updated nightly from
the development sources) is available at
@url{http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html}, along with procedures for updating
@code{tlmgr} itself and information about test versions.

TeX Live is organized into a few top-level @emph{schemes}, each of which is
specified as a different set of @emph{collections} and @emph{packages}, where a
collection is a set of packages, and a package is what contains actual
files.  Schemes typically contain a mix of collections and packages, but
each package is included in exactly one collection, no more and no less.
A TeX Live installation can be customized and managed at any level.

See @url{http://tug.org/texlive/doc} for all the TeX Live documentation
available.

@node tlmgr EXAMPLES
@appendixsec EXAMPLES

After successfully installing TeX Live, here are a few common operations
with @code{tlmgr}:

@table @asis
@item @code{tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet}}

Tell @code{tlmgr} to use a nearby CTAN mirror for future updates; useful if
you installed TeX Live from the DVD image and want continuing updates.

@item @code{tlmgr update --list}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{tlmgr update --list}}

Report what would be updated without actually updating anything.

@item @code{tlmgr update --all}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{tlmgr update --all}}

Make your local TeX installation correspond to what is in the package
repository (typically useful when updating from CTAN).

@item @code{tlmgr info} @emph{pkg}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{tlmgr info} @emph{pkg}}

Display detailed information about @emph{pkg}, such as the installation
status and description.

@end table

For all the capabilities and details of @code{tlmgr}, please read the
following voluminous information.

@node tlmgr OPTIONS
@appendixsec OPTIONS

The following options to @code{tlmgr} are global options, not specific to
any action.  All options, whether global or action-specific, can be
given anywhere on the command line, and in any order.  The first
non-option argument will be the main action.  In all cases,
@code{--}@emph{option} and @code{-}@emph{option} are equivalent, and an @code{=} is optional
between an option name and its value.

@table @asis
@item @strong{--repository} @emph{url|path}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--repository} @emph{url|path}}

Specifies the package repository from which packages should be installed
or updated, overriding the default package repository found in the
installation's TeX Live Package Database (a.k.a. the TLPDB, defined
entirely in the file @code{tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb}).  The documentation for
@code{install-tl} has more details about this
(@url{http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html}).

@code{--repository} changes the repository location only for the current
run; to make a permanent change, use @code{option repository} (see the
@ref{tlmgr option,, option} action).

For backward compatibility and convenience, @code{--location} and @code{--repo}
are accepted as aliases for this option.

@item @strong{--gui} [@emph{action}]
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--gui} [@emph{action}]}

@code{tlmgr} has a graphical interface as well as the command line
interface.  You can give this option, @code{--gui}, together with an action
to be brought directly into the respective screen of the GUI.  For
example, running

@verbatim
  tlmgr --gui update
@end verbatim

starts you directly at the update screen.  If no action is given, the
GUI will be started at the main screen.

@item @strong{--gui-lang} @emph{llcode}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--gui-lang} @emph{llcode}}

By default, the GUI tries to deduce your language from the environment
(on Windows via the registry, on Unix via @code{LC_MESSAGES}). If that fails
you can select a different language by giving this option with a
language code (based on ISO 639-1).  Currently supported (but not
necessarily completely translated) are: English (en, default), Czech
(cs), German (de), French (fr), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Dutch (nl),
Polish (pl), Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR), Russian (ru), Slovak (sk),
Slovenian (sl), Serbian (sr), Ukrainian (uk), Vietnamese (vi),
simplified Chinese (zh_CN), and traditional Chinese (zh_TW).

@item @strong{--debug-translation}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--debug-translation}}

In GUI mode, this switch tells @code{tlmgr} to report any untranslated (or
missing) messages to standard error.  This can help translators to see
what remains to be done.

@item @strong{--machine-readable}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--machine-readable}}

Instead of the normal output intended for human consumption, write (to
standard output) a fixed format more suitable for machine parsing.  See
the @ref{tlmgr MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT,, MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT} section below.

@item @strong{--no-execute-actions}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--no-execute-actions}}

Suppress the execution of the execute actions as defined in the tlpsrc
files.  Documented only for completeness, as this is only useful in
debugging.

@item @strong{--package-logfile} @emph{file}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--package-logfile} @emph{file}}

@code{tlmgr} logs all package actions (install, remove, update, failed
updates, failed restores) to a separate log file, by default
@code{TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c/tlmgr.log}.  This option allows you to specific a
different file for the log.

@item @strong{--pause}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--pause}}

This option makes @code{tlmgr} wait for user input before exiting.  Useful on
Windows to avoid disappearing command windows.

@item @strong{--persistent-downloads}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--persistent-downloads}}

@item @strong{--no-persistent-downloads}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--no-persistent-downloads}}

For network-based installations, this option (on by default) makes
@code{tlmgr} try to set up a persistent connection (using the @code{LWP} Perl
module).  The idea is to open and reuse only one connection per session
between your computer and the server, instead of initiating a new
download for each package.

If this is not possible, @code{tlmgr} will fall back to using @code{wget}.  To
disable these persistent connections, use @code{--no-persistent-downloads}.

@item @strong{--pin-file}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--pin-file}}

Change the pinning file location from @code{TEXMFLOCAL/tlpkg/pinning.txt}
(see @ref{tlmgr Pinning,, Pinning} below).  Documented only for completeness, as this is
only useful in debugging.

@item @strong{--usermode}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--usermode}}

Activates user mode for this run of @code{tlmgr}; see @ref{tlmgr USER MODE,, USER MODE} below.

@item @strong{--usertree} @emph{dir}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--usertree} @emph{dir}}

Uses @emph{dir} for the tree in user mode; see @ref{tlmgr USER MODE,, USER MODE} below.

@end table

The standard options for TeX Live programs are also accepted:
@code{--help/-h/-?}, @code{--version}, @code{-q} (no informational messages), @code{-v}
(debugging messages, can be repeated).  For the details about these, see
the @code{TeXLive::TLUtils} documentation.

The @code{--version} option shows version information about the TeX Live
release and about the @code{tlmgr} script itself.  If @code{-v} is also given,
revision number for the loaded TeX Live Perl modules are shown, too.

@node tlmgr help
@appendixsubsec help

Display this help information and exit (same as @code{--help}, and on the
web at @url{http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html}).  Sometimes the
@code{perldoc} and/or @code{PAGER} programs on the system have problems,
resulting in control characters being literally output.  This can't
always be detected, but you can set the @code{NOPERLDOC} environment
variable and @code{perldoc} will not be used.

@node tlmgr version
@appendixsubsec version

Gives version information (same as @code{--version}).

If @code{-v} has been given the revisions of the used modules are reported, too.

@node tlmgr backup [--clean[=@emph{N}]] [--backupdir @emph{dir}] [--all | @emph{pkg}]...
@appendixsubsec backup [--clean[=@emph{N}]] [--backupdir @emph{dir}] [--all | @emph{pkg}]...

If the @code{--clean} option is not specified, this action makes a backup of
the given packages, or all packages given @code{--all}. These backups are
saved to the value of the @code{--backupdir} option, if that is an existing and
writable directory. If @code{--backupdir} is not given, the @code{backupdir}
option setting in the TLPDB is used, if present.  If both are missing,
no backups are made.

If the @code{--clean} option is specified, backups are pruned (removed)
instead of saved. The optional integer value @emph{N} may be specified to
set the number of backups that will be retained when cleaning. If @code{N}
is not given, the value of the @code{autobackup} option is used. If both are
missing, an error is issued. For more details of backup pruning, see
the @code{option} action.

Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--backupdir} @emph{directory}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--backupdir} @emph{directory}}

Overrides the @code{backupdir} option setting in the TLPDB.
The @emph{directory} argument is required and must specify an existing,
writable directory where backups are to be placed.

@item @strong{--all}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--all}}

If @code{--clean} is not specified, make a backup of all packages in the TeX
Live installation; this will take quite a lot of space and time.  If
@code{--clean} is specified, all packages are pruned.

@item @strong{--clean}[=@emph{N}]
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--clean}[=@emph{N}]}

Instead of making backups, prune the backup directory of old backups, as
explained above. The optional integer argument @emph{N} overrides the
@code{autobackup} option set in the TLPDB.  You must use @code{--all} or a list
of packages together with this option, as desired.

@item @strong{--dry-run}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--dry-run}}

Nothing is actually backed up or removed; instead, the actions to be
performed are written to the terminal.

@end table

@node tlmgr candidates @emph{pkg}
@appendixsubsec candidates @emph{pkg}

@table @asis
@item @strong{candidates @emph{pkg}}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{candidates @emph{pkg}} 1}

Shows the available candidate repositories for package @emph{pkg}.
See @ref{tlmgr MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES,, MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES} below.

@end table

@node tlmgr check [@emph{option}]... [files|depends|executes|runfiles|all]
@appendixsubsec check [@emph{option}]... [files|depends|executes|runfiles|all]

Executes one (or all) check(s) on the consistency of the installation.

@table @asis
@item @strong{files}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{files}}

Checks that all files listed in the local TLPDB (@code{texlive.tlpdb}) are
actually present, and lists those missing.

@item @strong{depends}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{depends}}

Lists those packages which occur as dependencies in an installed collections,
but are themselves not installed, and those packages that are not
contained in any collection.

If you call @code{tlmgr check collections} this test will be carried out
instead since former versions for @code{tlmgr} called it that way.

@item @strong{executes}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{executes}}

Check that the files referred to by @code{execute} directives in the TeX
Live Database are present.

@item @strong{runfiles}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{runfiles}}

List those filenames that are occurring more than one time in the runfiles.

@end table

Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--use-svn}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--use-svn}}

Use the output of @code{svn status} instead of listing the files; for
checking the TL development repository.

@end table

@node tlmgr conf [texmf|tlmgr|updmap [--conffile @emph{file}] [--delete] [@emph{key} [@emph{value}]]]
@appendixsubsec conf [texmf|tlmgr|updmap [--conffile @emph{file}] [--delete] [@emph{key} [@emph{value}]]]

With only @code{conf}, show general configuration information for TeX Live,
including active configuration files, path settings, and more.  This is
like the @code{texconfig conf} call, but works on all supported platforms.

With either @code{conf texmf}, @code{conf tlmgr}, or @code{conf updmap} given in
addition, shows all key/value pairs (i.e., all settings) as saved in
@code{ROOT/texmf.cnf}, the tlmgr configuration file (see below), or the
first found (via kpsewhich) @code{updmap.cfg} file, respectively.

If @emph{key} is given in addition, shows the value of only that @emph{key} in
the respective file.  If option @emph{--delete} is also given, the
configuration file -- it is removed, not just commented out!

If @emph{value} is given in addition, @emph{key} is set to @emph{value} in the 
respective file.  @emph{No error checking is done!}

In all cases the file used can be explicitly specified via the option
@code{--conffile @emph{file}}, in case one wants to operate on a different file.

Practical application: if the execution of (some or all) system commands
via @code{\write18} was left enabled during installation, you can disable
it afterwards:

@verbatim
  tlmgr conf texmf shell_escape 0
@end verbatim

A more complicated example: the @code{TEXMFHOME} tree (see the main TeX Live
guide, @url{http://tug.org/texlive/doc.html}) can be set to multiple
directories, but they must be enclosed in braces and separated by
commas, so quoting the value to the shell is a good idea.  Thus:

@verbatim
  tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFHOME "{~/texmf,~/texmfbis}"
@end verbatim

Warning: The general facility is here, but tinkering with settings in
this way is very strongly discouraged.  Again, no error checking on
either keys or values is done, so any sort of breakage is possible.

@node tlmgr dump-tlpdb [--local|--remote]
@appendixsubsec dump-tlpdb [--local|--remote]

Dump complete local or remote TLPDB to standard output, as-is.  The
output is analogous to the @code{--machine-readable} output; see
@ref{tlmgr MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT,, MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT} section.

Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--local}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--local}}

Dump the local tlpdb.

@item @strong{--remote}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--remote}}

Dump the remote tlpdb.

@end table

Exactly one of @code{--local} and @code{--remote} must be given.

In either case, the first line of the output specifies the repository
location, in this format:

@verbatim
  "location-url" "\t" location
@end verbatim

where @code{location-url} is the literal field name, followed by a tab, and
@emph{location} is the file or url to the repository.

Line endings may be either LF or CRLF depending on the current platform.

@node tlmgr generate [@emph{option}]... @emph{what}
@appendixsubsec generate [@emph{option}]... @emph{what}

@table @asis
@item @strong{generate language}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{generate language}}

@item @strong{generate language.dat}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{generate language.dat}}

@item @strong{generate language.def}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{generate language.def}}

@item @strong{generate language.dat.lua}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{generate language.dat.lua}}

@item @strong{generate fmtutil}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{generate fmtutil}}

@end table

The @code{generate} action overwrites any manual changes made in the
respective files: it recreates them from scratch based on the
information of the installed packages, plus local adaptions.
The TeX Live installer and @code{tlmgr} routinely call @code{generate} for
all of these files.

For managing your own fonts, please read the @code{updmap --help}
information and/or @url{http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html}.

In more detail: @code{generate} remakes any of the configuration files
@code{language.dat}, @code{language.def}, @code{language.dat.lua}, and
@code{fmtutil.cnf}, from the information present in the local TLPDB, plus
locally-maintained files.

The locally-maintained files are @code{language-local.dat},
@code{language-local.def}, @code{language-local.dat.lua}, or
@code{fmtutil-local.cnf}, searched for in @code{TEXMFLOCAL} in the respective
directories.  If local additions are present, the final file is made by
starting with the main file, omitting any entries that the local file
specifies to be disabled, and finally appending the local file.

(Historical note: The formerly supported @code{updmap-local.cfg} is no longer
read, since @code{updmap} now supports multiple @code{updmap.cfg} files.  Thus,
local additions can and should be put into an @code{updmap.cfg} file in
@code{TEXMFLOCAL}.  The @code{generate updmap} action no longer exists.)

Local files specify entries to be disabled with a comment line, namely
one of these:

@verbatim
  #!NAME
  %!NAME
  --!NAME
@end verbatim

where @code{fmtutil.cnf} uses @code{#}, @code{language.dat} and @code{language.def} use
@code{%}, and @code{language.dat.lua} use @code{--}.  In all cases, the @emph{name} is
the respective format name or hyphenation pattern identifier.
Examples:

@verbatim
  #!pdflatex
  %!german
  --!usenglishmax
@end verbatim

(Of course, you're not likely to actually want to disable those
particular items.  They're just examples.)

After such a disabling line, the local file can include another entry
for the same item, if a different definition is desired.  In general,
except for the special disabling lines, the local files follow the same
syntax as the master files.

The form @code{generate language} recreates all three files @code{language.dat},
@code{language.def}, and @code{language.dat.lua}, while the forms with an
extension recreates only that given language file.

Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--dest} @emph{output_file}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--dest} @emph{output_file}}

specifies the output file (defaults to the respective location in
@code{TEXMFSYSVAR}).  If @code{--dest} is given to @code{generate language}, it
serves as a basename onto which @code{.dat} will be appended for the name of
the @code{language.dat} output file, @code{.def} will be appended to the value
for the name of the @code{language.def} output file, and @code{.dat.lua} to the
name of the @code{language.dat.lua} file.  (This is just to avoid
overwriting; if you want a specific name for each output file, we
recommend invoking @code{tlmgr} twice.)

@item @strong{--localcfg} @emph{local_conf_file}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--localcfg} @emph{local_conf_file}}

specifies the (optional) local additions (defaults to the respective
location in @code{TEXMFLOCAL}).

@item @strong{--rebuild-sys}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--rebuild-sys}}

tells tlmgr to run necessary programs after config files have been
regenerated. These are:
@code{fmtutil-sys --all} after @code{generate fmtutil},
@code{fmtutil-sys --byhyphen .../language.dat} after @code{generate language.dat},
and
@code{fmtutil-sys --byhyphen .../language.def} after @code{generate language.def}.

These subsequent calls cause the newly-generated files to actually take
effect.  This is not done by default since those calls are lengthy
processes and one might want to made several related changes in
succession before invoking these programs.

@end table

The respective locations are as follows:

@verbatim
  tex/generic/config/language.dat (and language-local.dat);
  tex/generic/config/language.def (and language-local.def);
  tex/generic/config/language.dat.lua (and language-local.dat.lua);
  web2c/fmtutil.cnf (and fmtutil-local.cnf);
@end verbatim

@node tlmgr gui
@appendixsubsec gui

Start the graphical user interface. See @strong{GUI} below.

@node tlmgr info [@emph{option}...] [collections|schemes|@emph{pkg}...]
@appendixsubsec info [@emph{option}...] [collections|schemes|@emph{pkg}...]

With no argument, lists all packages available at the package
repository, prefixing those already installed with @code{i}.

With the single word @code{collections} or @code{schemes} as the argument, lists
the request type instead of all packages.

With any other arguments, display information about @emph{pkg}: the name,
category, short and long description, installation status, and TeX Live
revision number.  If @emph{pkg} is not locally installed, searches in the
remote installation source.

It also displays information taken from the TeX Catalogue, namely the
package version, date, and license.  Consider these, especially the
package version, as approximations only, due to timing skew of the
updates of the different pieces.  By contrast, the @code{revision} value
comes directly from TL and is reliable.

The former actions @code{show} and @code{list} are merged into this action,
but are still supported for backward compatibility.

Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--list}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--list}}

If the option @code{--list} is given with a package, the list of contained
files is also shown, including those for platform-specific dependencies.
When given with schemes and collections, @code{--list} outputs their
dependencies in a similar way.

@item @strong{--only-installed}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--only-installed}}

If this options is given,  the installation source will
not be used; only locally installed packages, collections, or schemes
are listed.
(Does not work for listing of packages for now)

@item @strong{--taxonomy}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--taxonomy}}

@item @strong{--keyword}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--keyword}}

@item @strong{--functionality}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--functionality}}

@item @strong{--characterization}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--characterization}}

In addition to the normal data displayed, also display information for
given packages from the corresponding taxonomy (or all of them).  See
@ref{tlmgr TAXONOMIES,, TAXONOMIES} below for details.

@end table

@node tlmgr init-usertree
@appendixsubsec init-usertree

Sets up a texmf tree for so-called user mode management, either the
default user tree (@code{TEXMFHOME}), or one specified on the command line
with @code{--usertree}.  See @ref{tlmgr USER MODE,, USER MODE} below.

@node tlmgr install [@emph{option}]... @emph{pkg}...
@appendixsubsec install [@emph{option}]... @emph{pkg}...

Install each @emph{pkg} given on the command line. By default this installs
all packages on which the given @emph{pkg}s are dependent, also.  Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--file}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--file}}

Instead of fetching a package from the installation repository, use
the package files given on the command line.  These files must
be standard TeX Live package files (with contained tlpobj file).

@item @strong{--reinstall}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--reinstall}}

Reinstall a package (including dependencies for collections) even if it
already seems to be installed (i.e, is present in the TLPDB).  This is
useful to recover from accidental removal of files in the hierarchy.

When re-installing, only dependencies on normal packages are followed
(i.e., not those of category Scheme or Collection).

@item @strong{--no-depends}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--no-depends}}

Do not install dependencies.  (By default, installing a package ensures
that all dependencies of this package are fulfilled.)

@item @strong{--no-depends-at-all}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--no-depends-at-all}}

Normally, when you install a package which ships binary files the
respective binary package will also be installed.  That is, for a
package @code{foo}, the package @code{foo.i386-linux} will also be installed on
an @code{i386-linux} system.  This option suppresses this behavior, and also
implies @code{--no-depends}.  Don't use it unless you are sure of what you
are doing.

@item @strong{--dry-run}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--dry-run} 1}

Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be performed are
written to the terminal.

@item @strong{--force}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--force}}

If updates to @code{tlmgr} itself (or other parts of the basic
infrastructure) are present, @code{tlmgr} will bail out and not perform the
installation unless this option is given.  Not recommended.

@end table

@anchor{tlmgr @strong{option showall}}

@item @strong{option @emph{key} [@emph{value}]}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{option @emph{key} [@emph{value}]}}

@end table

The first form shows the global TeX Live settings currently saved in the
TLPDB with a short description and the @code{key} used for changing it in
parentheses.

The second form is similar, but also shows options which can be defined
but are not currently set to any value.

In the third form, if @emph{value} is not given, the setting for @emph{key} is
displayed.  If @emph{value} is present, @emph{key} is set to @emph{value}.

Possible values for @emph{key} are (run @code{tlmgr option showall} for
the definitive list):

@verbatim
 repository (default package repository),

@end verbatim

One common use of @code{option} is to permanently change the installation to
get further updates from the Internet, after originally installing from
DVD.  To do this, you can run

@verbatim
 tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
@end verbatim

The @code{install-tl} documentation has more information about the possible
values for @code{repository}.  (For backward compatibility, @code{location} can
be used as alternative name for @code{repository}.)

If @code{formats} is set (this is the default), then formats are regenerated
when either the engine or the format files have changed.  Disable this
only when you know what you are doing.

The @code{postcode} option controls execution of per-package
postinstallation action code.  It is set by default, and again disabling
is not likely to be of interest except perhaps to developers.

The @code{docfiles} and @code{srcfiles} options control the installation of
their respective files of a package. By default both are enabled (1).
This can be disabled (set to 0) if disk space is (very) limited.

The options @code{autobackup} and @code{backupdir} determine the defaults for
the actions @code{update}, @code{backup} and @code{restore}.  These three actions
need a directory in which to read or write the backups.  If
@code{--backupdir} is not specified on the command line, the @code{backupdir}
option value is used (if set).

The @code{autobackup} option (de)activates automatic generation of backups.
Its value is an integer.  If the @code{autobackup} value is @code{-1}, no
backups are removed.  If @code{autobackup} is 0 or more, it specifies the
number of backups to keep.  Thus, backups are disabled if the value is
0.  In the @code{--clean} mode of the @code{backup} action this option also
specifies the number to be kept.

To setup @code{autobackup} to @code{-1} on the command line, use:

@verbatim
  tlmgr option -- autobackup -1
@end verbatim

The @code{--} avoids having the @code{-1} treated as an option.  (@code{--} stops
parsing for options at the point where it appears; this is a general
feature across most Unix programs.)

The @code{sys_bin}, @code{sys_man}, and @code{sys_info} options are used on
Unix-like systems to control the generation of links for executables,
info files and man pages. See the @code{path} action for details.

The last three options control behaviour on Windows installations.  If
@code{desktop_integration} is set, then some packages will install items in
a sub-folder of the Start menu for @code{tlmgr gui}, documentation, etc.  If
@code{fileassocs} is set, Windows file associations are made (see also the
@code{postaction} action).  Finally, if @code{multiuser} is set, then adaptions
to the registry and the menus are done for all users on the system
instead of only the current user.  All three options are on by default.

@node tlmgr paper
@appendixsubsec paper

@table @asis

@end table

With no arguments (@code{tlmgr paper}), shows the default paper size setting
for all known programs.

With one argument (e.g., @code{tlmgr paper a4}), sets the default for all
known programs to that paper size.

With a program given as the first argument and no paper size specified
(e.g., @code{tlmgr dvips paper}), shows the default paper size for that
program.

With a program given as the first argument and a paper size as the last
argument (e.g., @code{tlmgr dvips paper a4}), set the default for that
program to that paper size.

With a program given as the first argument and @code{--list} given as the
last argument (e.g., @code{tlmgr dvips paper --list}), shows all valid paper
sizes for that program.  The first size shown is the default.

Incidentally, this syntax of having a specific program name before the
@code{paper} keyword is unusual.  It is inherited from the longstanding
@code{texconfig} script, which supports other configuration settings for
some programs, notably @code{dvips}.  @code{tlmgr} does not support those extra
settings.

@node tlmgr path [--w32mode=user|admin] [add|remove]
@appendixsubsec path [--w32mode=user|admin] [add|remove]

On Unix, merely adds or removes symlinks for binaries, man pages, and
info pages in the system directories specified by the respective options
(see the @ref{tlmgr option,, option} description above).  Does not change any
initialization files, either system or personal.

On Windows, the registry part where the binary directory is added or
removed is determined in the following way:

If the user has admin rights, and the option @code{--w32mode} is not given,
the setting @emph{w32_multi_user} determines the location (i.e., if it is
on then the system path, otherwise the user path is changed).

If the user has admin rights, and the option @code{--w32mode} is given, this
option determines the path to be adjusted.

If the user does not have admin rights, and the option @code{--w32mode}
is not given, and the setting @emph{w32_multi_user} is off, the user path
is changed, while if the setting @emph{w32_multi_user} is on, a warning is
issued that the caller does not have enough privileges.

If the user does not have admin rights, and the option @code{--w32mode}
is given, it must be @strong{user} and the user path will be adjusted. If a
user without admin rights uses the option @code{--w32mode admin} a warning
is issued that the caller does not have enough privileges.

@node tlmgr pinning
@appendixsubsec pinning

The @code{pinning} action manages the pinning file, see @ref{tlmgr Pinning,, Pinning} below.

@table @asis
@item @code{pinning show}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{pinning show}}

Shows the current pinning data.

@item @code{pinning add} @emph{repo} @emph{pkgglob}...
@anchor{tlmgr @code{pinning add} @emph{repo} @emph{pkgglob}...}

Pins the packages matching the @emph{pkgglob}(s) to the repository
@emph{repo}.

@item @code{pinning remove} @emph{repo} @emph{pkgglob}...
@anchor{tlmgr @code{pinning remove} @emph{repo} @emph{pkgglob}...}

Any packages recorded in the pinning file matching the <pkgglob>s for
the given repository @emph{repo} are removed.

@item @code{pinning remove @emph{repo} --all}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{pinning remove @emph{repo} --all}}

@appendixsubsec platform set auto

@code{platform list} lists the TeX Live names of all the platforms
(a.k.a. architectures), (@code{i386-linux}, ...) available at the package
repository.

@code{platform add} @emph{platform}... adds the executables for each given platform
@emph{platform} to the installation from the repository.

@code{platform remove} @emph{platform}... removes the executables for each given 
platform @emph{platform} from the installation, but keeps the currently 
running platform in any case.

@code{platform set} @emph{platform} switches TeX Live to always use the given
platform instead of auto detection.

@code{platform set auto} switches TeX Live to auto detection mode for platform.

Platform detection is needed to select the proper @code{xz}, @code{xzdec} and 
@code{wget} binaries that are shipped with TeX Live.

@code{arch} is a synonym for @code{platform}.

Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--dry-run}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--dry-run} 2}

Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be performed are
written to the terminal.

@end table

@node tlmgr postaction [--w32mode=user|admin] [--fileassocmode=1|2] [--all] [install|remove] [shortcut|fileassoc|script] [@emph{pkg}]...
@appendixsubsec postaction [--w32mode=user|admin] [--fileassocmode=1|2] [--all] [install|remove] [shortcut|fileassoc|script] [@emph{pkg}]...

Carry out the postaction @code{shortcut}, @code{fileassoc}, or @code{script} given
as the second required argument in install or remove mode (which is the
first required argument), for either the packages given on the command
line, or for all if @code{--all} is given.

If the option @code{--w32mode} is given the value @code{user}, all actions will
only be carried out in the user-accessible parts of the
registry/filesystem, while the value @code{admin} selects the system-wide
parts of the registry for the file associations.  If you do not have
enough permissions, using @code{--w32mode=admin} will not succeed.

@code{--fileassocmode} specifies the action for file associations.  If it is
set to 1 (the default), only new associations are added; if it is set to
2, all associations are set to the TeX Live programs.  (See also
@code{option fileassocs}.)

@node tlmgr print-platform
@appendixsubsec print-platform

Print the TeX Live identifier for the detected platform
(hardware/operating system) combination to standard output, and exit.
@code{--print-arch} is a synonym.

@node tlmgr restore [--backupdir @emph{dir}] [--all | @emph{pkg} [@emph{rev}]]
@appendixsubsec restore [--backupdir @emph{dir}] [--all | @emph{pkg} [@emph{rev}]]

Restore a package from a previously-made backup.

If @code{--all} is given, try to restore the latest revision of all 
package backups found in the backup directory.

Otherwise, if neither @emph{pkg} nor @emph{rev} are given, list the available backup
revisions for all packages.

With @emph{pkg} given but no @emph{rev}, list all available backup revisions of
@emph{pkg}.

When listing available packages tlmgr shows the revision and in 
parenthesis the creation time if available (in format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm).

With both @emph{pkg} and @emph{rev}, tries to restore the package from the
specified backup.

Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--all}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--all} 1}

Try to restore the latest revision of all package backups found in the
backup directory. Additional non-option arguments (like @emph{pkg}) are not
allowed.

@item @strong{--backupdir} @emph{directory}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--backupdir} @emph{directory} 1}

Specify the directory where the backups are to be found. If not given it
will be taken from the configuration setting in the TLPDB.

@item @strong{--dry-run}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--dry-run} 3}

Nothing is actually restored; instead, the actions to be performed are
written to the terminal.

@item @strong{--force}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--force} 1}

Don't ask questions.

@end table

@node tlmgr remove [@emph{option}]... @emph{pkg}...
@appendixsubsec remove [@emph{option}]... @emph{pkg}...

Remove each @emph{pkg} specified.  Removing a collection removes all package
dependencies (unless @code{--no-depends} is specified), but not any
collection dependencies of that collection.  However, when removing a
package, dependencies are never removed.  Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--no-depends}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--no-depends} 1}

Do not remove dependent packages.

@item @strong{--no-depends-at-all}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--no-depends-at-all} 1}

See above under @strong{install} (and beware).

@item @strong{--force}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--force} 2}

By default, removal of a package or collection that is a dependency of
another collection or scheme is not allowed.  With this option, the
package will be removed unconditionally.  Use with care.

A package that has been removed using the @code{--force} option because it
is still listed in an installed collection or scheme will not be
updated, and will be mentioned as @strong{forcibly removed} in the output of
@strong{tlmgr update --list}.

@item @strong{--dry-run}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--dry-run} 4}

Nothing is actually removed; instead, the actions to be performed are
written to the terminal.

@item @strong{repository set @emph{path}[#@emph{tag}] [@emph{path}[#@emph{tag}] ...]}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{repository set @emph{path}[#@emph{tag}] [@emph{path}[#@emph{tag}] ...]}}

This action manages the list of repositories.  See @ref{tlmgr MULTIPLE
REPOSITORIES,, MULTIPLE
REPOSITORIES} below for detailed explanations.

The first form (@code{list}) lists all configured repositories and the
respective tags if set. If a path, url, or tag is given after the
@code{list} keyword, it is interpreted as source from where to 
initialize a TeX Live Database and lists the contained packages.
This can also be an up-to-now not used repository, both locally
and remote. If one pass in addition @code{--with-platforms}, for each
package the available platforms (if any) are listed, too.

The third form (@code{add}) adds a repository
(optionally attaching a tag) to the list of repositories.  The forth
form (@code{remove}) removes a repository, either by full path/url, or by
tag.  The last form (@code{set}) sets the list of repositories to the items
given on the command line, not keeping previous settings

In all cases, one of the repositories must be tagged as @code{main};
otherwise, all operations will fail!

as a regular expression.

Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--global}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--global}}

Search the TeX Live Database of the installation medium, instead of the
local installation.

@item @strong{--word}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--word}}

Restrict the search to match only full words. For example, searching for
@code{table} with this option will not output packages containing the
word @code{tables} (unless they also contain the word @code{table} on its own).

@item @strong{--list}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--list} 1}

If a search for any (or all) taxonomies is done, by specifying one of
the taxonomy options below, then instead of searching for packages, list
the entire corresponding taxonomy (or all of them).  See
@ref{tlmgr TAXONOMIES,, TAXONOMIES} below.

@end table

Other search options are selected by specifying one of the following:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--file}

@item @strong{--taxonomy}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--taxonomy} 1}

@item @strong{--functionality}

Search in the corresponding taxonomy (or all) instead of the package
descriptions.  See @ref{tlmgr TAXONOMIES,, TAXONOMIES} below.

@item @strong{--all}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--all} 2}

Search for package names, descriptions, and taxonomies, but not files.

@end table

@node tlmgr uninstall
@appendixsubsec uninstall

Uninstalls the entire TeX Live installation.  Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--force}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--force} 3}

Do not ask for confirmation, remove immediately.

@end table

@node tlmgr update [@emph{option}]... [@emph{pkg}]...
@appendixsubsec update [@emph{option}]... [@emph{pkg}]...

Updates the packages given as arguments to the latest version available
at the installation source.  Either @code{--all} or at least one @emph{pkg} name
must be specified.  Options:

@table @asis
@item @strong{--all}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--all} 3}

Update all installed packages except for @code{tlmgr} itself.  Thus, if
updates to @code{tlmgr} itself are present, this will simply give an error,
unless also the option @code{--force} or @code{--self} is given.  (See below.)

In addition to updating the installed packages, during the update of a
collection the local installation is (by default) synchronized to the
status of the collection on the server, for both additions and removals.

This means that if a package has been removed on the server (and thus
has also been removed from the respective collection), @code{tlmgr} will
remove the package in the local installation.  This is called
``auto-remove'' and is announced as such when using the option
@code{--list}.  This auto-removal can be suppressed using the option
@code{--no-auto-remove} (not recommended, see option description).

Analogously, if a package has been added to a collection on the server
that is also installed locally, it will be added to the local
installation.  This is called ``auto-install'' and is announced as such
when using the option @code{--list}.  This auto-installation can be
suppressed using the option @code{--no-auto-install}.

An exception to the collection dependency checks (including the
auto-installation of packages just mentioned) are those that have been
``forcibly removed'' by you, that is, you called @code{tlmgr remove --force}
on them.  (See the @code{remove} action documentation.)  To reinstall any
such forcibly removed packages use @code{--reinstall-forcibly-removed}.

If you want to exclude some packages from the current update run (e.g.,
due to a slow link), see the @code{--exclude} option below.

@item @strong{--self}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--self}}

Update @code{tlmgr} itself (that is, the infrastructure packages) if updates
to it are present. On Windows this includes updates to the private Perl
interpreter shipped inside TeX Live.

If this option is given together with either @code{--all} or a list of
packages, then @code{tlmgr} will be updated first and, if this update
succeeds, the new version will be restarted to complete the rest of the
updates.

In short:

@verbatim
  tlmgr update --self        # update infrastructure only
  tlmgr update --self --all  # update infrastructure and all packages
  tlmgr update --force --all # update all packages but *not* infrastructure
                             # ... this last at your own risk, not recommended!
@end verbatim

@item @strong{--dry-run}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--dry-run} 5}

Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be performed are
written to the terminal.  This is a more detailed report than @code{--list}.

@item @strong{--list} [@emph{pkg}]
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--list} [@emph{pkg}]}

Concisely list the packages which would be updated, newly installed, or
removed, without actually changing anything. 
If @code{--all} is also given, all available updates are listed.
If @code{--self} is given, but not @code{--all}, only updates to the
critical packages (tlmgr, texlive infrastructure, perl on Windows, etc.)
are listed.
If neither @code{--all} nor @code{--self} is given, and in addition no @emph{pkg} is
given, then @code{--all} is assumed (thus, @code{tlmgr update --list} is the
same as @code{tlmgr update --list --all}).
If neither @code{--all} nor @code{--self} is given, but specific package names are
given, those packages are checked for updates.

@item @strong{--exclude} @emph{pkg}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--exclude} @emph{pkg}}

Exclude @emph{pkg} from the update process.  If this option is given more
than once, its arguments accumulate.

An argument @emph{pkg} excludes both the package @emph{pkg} itself and all
its related platform-specific packages @emph{pkg.ARCH}.  For example,

@verbatim
  tlmgr update --all --exclude a2ping
@end verbatim

will not update @code{a2ping}, @code{a2ping.i386-linux}, or
any other @code{a2ping.}@emph{ARCH} package.

If this option specifies a package that would otherwise be a candidate
for auto-installation, auto-removal, or reinstallation of a forcibly
removed package, @code{tlmgr} quits with an error message.  Excludes are not
supported in these circumstances.

@item @strong{--no-auto-remove} [@emph{pkg}]...
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--no-auto-remove} [@emph{pkg}]...}

By default, @code{tlmgr} tries to remove packages which have disappeared on
the server, as described above under @code{--all}.  This option prevents
such removals, either for all packages (with @code{--all}), or for just the
given @emph{pkg} names.  This can lead to an inconsistent TeX installation,
since packages are not infrequently renamed or replaced by their
authors.  Therefore this is not recommend.

@item @strong{--no-auto-install} [@emph{pkg}]...
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--no-auto-install} [@emph{pkg}]...}

Under normal circumstances @code{tlmgr} will install packages which are new
on the server, as described above under @code{--all}.  This option prevents
any such automatic installation, either for all packages (with
@code{--all}), or the given @emph{pkg} names.

Furthermore, after the @code{tlmgr} run using this has finished, the
packages that would have been auto-installed @emph{will be considered as
forcibly removed}.  So, if @code{foobar} is the only new package on the
server, then

@verbatim
  tlmgr update --all --no-auto-install
@end verbatim

is equivalent to

@verbatim
  tlmgr update --all
  tlmgr remove --force foobar
@end verbatim

@item @strong{--reinstall-forcibly-removed}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--reinstall-forcibly-removed}}

Under normal circumstances @code{tlmgr} will not install packages that have
been forcibly removed by the user; that is, removed with @code{remove
--force}, or whose installation was prohibited by @code{--no-auto-install}
during an earlier update.

This option makes @code{tlmgr} ignore the forcible removals and re-install
all such packages. This can be used to completely synchronize an
installation with the server's idea of what is available:

@verbatim
  tlmgr update --reinstall-forcibly-removed --all
@end verbatim

@item @strong{--backup} and @strong{--backupdir} @emph{directory}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--backup} and @strong{--backupdir} @emph{directory}}

These two options control the creation of backups of packages @emph{before}
updating; that is, backup of packages as currently installed.  If
neither of these options are given, no backup package will be saved. If
@code{--backupdir} is given and specifies a writable directory then a backup
will be made in that location. If only @code{--backup} is given, then a
backup will be made to the directory previously set via the @code{option}
action (see below). If both are given then a backup will be made to the
specified @emph{directory}.

You can set options via the @code{option} action to automatically create
backups for all packages, and/or keep only a certain number of
backups.  Please see the @code{option} action for details.

@code{tlmgr} always makes a temporary backup when updating packages, in case
of download or other failure during an update.  In contrast, the purpose
of this @code{--backup} option is to allow you to save a persistent backup
in case the actual @emph{content} of the update causes problems, e.g.,
introduces an incompatibility.

The @code{restore} action explains how to restore from a backup.

@item @strong{--no-depends}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--no-depends} 2}

If you call for updating a package normally all depending packages
will also be checked for updates and updated if necessary. This switch
suppresses this behavior.

@item @strong{--no-depends-at-all}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--no-depends-at-all} 2}

See above under @strong{install} (and beware).

@item @strong{--force}
@anchor{tlmgr @strong{--force} 4}

Force update of normal packages, without updating @code{tlmgr} itself 
(unless the @code{--self} option is also given).  Not recommended.

Also, @code{update --list} is still performed regardless of this option.

@end table

If the package on the server is older than the package already installed
(e.g., if the selected mirror is out of date), @code{tlmgr} does not
downgrade.  Also, packages for uninstalled platforms are not installed.

@node tlmgr USER MODE
@appendixsec USER MODE

@code{tlmgr} provides a restricted way, called ``user mode'', to manage
arbitrary texmf trees in the same way as the main installation.  For
example, this allows people without write permissions on the
installation location to update/install packages into a tree of their
own.

@code{tlmgr} is switched into user mode with the command line option
@code{--usermode}.  It does not switch automatically, nor is there any
configuration file setting for it.  Thus, this option has to be
explicitly given every time user mode is to be activated.

This mode of @code{tlmgr} works on a user tree, by default the value of the
@code{TEXMFHOME} variable.  This can be overridden with the command line
option @code{--usertree}.  In the following when we speak of the user tree
we mean either @code{TEXMFHOME} or the one given on the command line.

Not all actions are allowed in user mode; @code{tlmgr} will warn you and not
carry out any problematic actions.  Currently not supported (and
probably will never be) is the @code{platform} action.  The @code{gui} action is
currently not supported, but may be in a future release.

Some @code{tlmgr} actions don't need any write permissions and thus work the
same in user mode and normal mode.  Currently these are: @code{check},
@code{help}, @code{list}, @code{print-platform}, @code{search}, @code{show}, @code{version}.

On the other hand, most of the actions dealing with package management
do need write permissions, and thus behave differently in user mode, as
described below: @code{install}, @code{update}, @code{remove}, @code{option}, @code{paper},
@code{generate}, @code{backup}, @code{restore}, @code{uninstall}, @code{symlinks}.

Before using @code{tlmgr} in user mode, you have to set up the user tree
with the @code{init-usertree} action.  This creates @emph{usertree}@code{/web2c} and
@emph{usertree}@code{/tlpkg/tlpobj}, and a minimal
@emph{usertree}@code{/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb}.  At that point, you can tell
@code{tlmgr} to do the (supported) actions by adding the @code{--usermode}
command line option.

In user mode the file @emph{usertree}@code{/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb} contains only
the packages that have been installed into the user tree using @code{tlmgr},
plus additional options from the ``virtual'' package
@code{00texlive.installation} (similar to the main installation's
@code{texlive.tlpdb}).

All actions on packages in user mode can only be carried out on packages
that are known as @code{relocatable}.  This excludes all packages containing
executables and a few other core packages.  Of the 2500 or so packages
currently in TeX Live the vast majority are relocatable and can be
installed into a user tree.

Description of changes of actions in user mode:

@menu
* tlmgr user mode install::
* tlmgr user mode backup; restore; remove; update::
* tlmgr user mode generate; option; paper::
@end menu

@node tlmgr user mode install
@appendixsubsec user mode install

In user mode, the @code{install} action checks that the package and all
dependencies are all either relocated or already installed in the system
installation.  If this is the case, it unpacks all containers to be
installed into the user tree (to repeat, that's either @code{TEXMFHOME} or
the value of @code{--usertree}) and add the respective packages to the user
tree's @code{texlive.tlpdb} (creating it if need be).

Currently installing a collection in user mode installs all dependent
packages, but in contrast to normal mode, does @emph{not} install dependent
collections.  For example, in normal mode @code{tlmgr install
collection-context} would install @code{collection-basic} and other
collections, while in user mode, @emph{only} the packages mentioned in
@code{collection-context} are installed.

@node tlmgr user mode backup; restore; remove; update
@appendixsubsec user mode backup; restore; remove; update

In user mode, these actions check that all packages to be acted on are
installed in the user tree before proceeding; otherwise, they behave
just as in normal mode.

@node tlmgr user mode generate; option; paper
@appendixsubsec user mode generate; option; paper

In user mode, these actions operate only on the user tree's
configuration files and/or @code{texlive.tlpdb}.
creates configuration files in user tree

@node tlmgr CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR
@appendixsec CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR

A small subset of the command line options can be set in a config file
for @code{tlmgr} which resides in @code{TEXMFCONFIG/tlmgr/config}.  By default, the
config file is in @code{~/.texliveYYYY/texmf-config/tlmgr/config} (replacing
@code{YYYY} with the year of your TeX Live installation). This is @emph{not}
@code{TEXMFSYSVAR}, so that the file is specific to a single user.

In this file, empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.  All
other lines must look like

@verbatim
  key = value
@end verbatim

where the allowed keys are @code{gui-expertmode} (value 0 or 1),
@code{persistent-downloads} (value 0 or 1), @code{auto-remove} (value 0 or 1),
and @code{gui-lang} (value like in the command line option).

@code{persistent-downloads}, @code{gui-lang}, and @code{auto-remove} correspond to
the respective command line options of the same name.  @code{gui-expertmode}
switches between the full GUI and a simplified GUI with only the
important and mostly used settings.

@node tlmgr TAXONOMIES
@appendixsec TAXONOMIES

tlmgr allows searching and listing of various categorizations, which we
call @emph{taxonomies}, as provided by an enhanced TeX Catalogue (available
for testing at @url{http://az.ctan.org}).  This is useful when, for
example, you don't know a specific package name but have an idea of the
functionality you need; or when you want to see all packages relating to
a given area.

There are three different taxonomies, specified by the following
options:

@table @asis
@item @code{--keyword}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{--keyword} 2}

The keywords, as specified at @url{http://az.ctan.org/keyword}.

@item @code{--functionality}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{--functionality} 2}

The ``by-topic'' categorization created by J\"urgen Fenn, as specified
at @url{http://az.ctan.org/characterization/by-function}.

@item @code{--characterization}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{--characterization} 2}

Both the primary and secondary functionalities, as specified at
@url{http://az.ctan.org/characterization/choose_dimen}.

@item @code{--taxonomy}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{--taxonomy} 2}

Operate on all the taxonomies.

@end table

The taxonomies are updated nightly and stored within TeX Live, so
Internet access is not required to search them.

Examples:

@verbatim
  tlmgr search --taxonomy exercise      # check all taxonomies for "exercise"
  tlmgr search --taxonomy --word table  # check for "table" on its own
  tlmgr search --list --keyword         # dump entire keyword taxonomy
  tlmgr show --taxonomy pdftex          # show pdftex package information,
                                        #   including all taxonomy entries
@end verbatim

@node tlmgr MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES
@appendixsec MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES

The main TeX Live repository contains a vast array of packages.
Nevertheless, additional local repositories can be useful to provide
locally-installed resources, such as proprietary fonts and house styles.
Also, alternative package repositories distribute packages that cannot
or should not be included in TeX Live, for whatever reason.

The simplest and most reliable method is to temporarily set the
installation source to any repository (with the @code{-repository} or
@code{option repository} command line options), and perform your operations.

When you are using multiple repositories over a sustained time, however,
explicitly switching between them becomes inconvenient.  Thus, it's
possible to tell @code{tlmgr} about additional repositories you want to use.
The basic command is @code{tlmgr repository add}.  The rest of this section
explains further.

When using multiple repositories, one of them has to be set as the main
repository, which distributes most of the installed packages.  When you
switch from a single repository installation to a multiple repository
installation, the previous sole repository will be set as the main
repository.

By default, even if multiple repositories are configured, packages are
@emph{still} @emph{only} installed from the main repository.  Thus, simply
adding a second repository does not actually enable installation of
anything from there.  You also have to specify which packages should be
taken from the new repository, by specifying so-called ``pinning''
rules, described next.

@menu
* tlmgr Pinning::
@end menu

@node tlmgr Pinning
@appendixsubsec Pinning

When a package @code{foo} is pinned to a repository, a package @code{foo} in any
other repository, even if it has a higher revision number, will not be
considered an installable candidate.

As mentioned above, by default everything is pinned to the main
repository.  Let's now go through an example of setting up a second
repository and enabling updates of a package from it.

First, check that we have support for multiple repositories, and have
only one enabled (as is the case by default):

@verbatim
 $ tlmgr repository list
 List of repositories (with tags if set):
   /var/www/norbert/tlnet
@end verbatim

Ok.  Let's add the @code{tlcontrib} repository (this is a real
repository, hosted at @url{http://tlcontrib.metatex.org}, maintained by
Taco Hoekwater et al.), with the tag @code{tlcontrib}:

@verbatim
 $ tlmgr repository add http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2012 tlcontrib
@end verbatim

Check the repository list again:

@verbatim
 $ tlmgr repository list
 List of repositories (with tags if set):
    http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2012 (tlcontrib)
    /var/www/norbert/tlnet (main)
@end verbatim

Now we specify a pinning entry to get the package @code{context} from
@code{tlcontrib}:

@verbatim
 $ tlmgr pinning add tlcontrib context
@end verbatim

Check that we can find @code{context}:

@verbatim
 $ tlmgr show context
 tlmgr: package repositories:
 ...
 package:     context
 repository:  tlcontrib/26867
 ...
@end verbatim

- install @code{context}:

@verbatim
 $ tlmgr install context
 tlmgr: package repositories:
 ...
 [1/1,  ??:??/??:??] install: context @tlcontrib [
@end verbatim

In the output here you can see that the @code{context} package has been
installed from the @code{tlcontrib} repository (@code{@@tlcontrib}).

Finally, @code{tlmgr pinning} also supports removing certain or all packages
from a given repository:

@verbatim
  $ tlmgr pinning remove tlcontrib context  # remove just context
  $ tlmgr pinning remove tlcontrib --all    # take nothing from tlcontrib
@end verbatim

A summary of the @code{tlmgr pinning} actions is given above.

@node tlmgr GUI FOR TLMGR
@appendixsec GUI FOR TLMGR

The graphical user interface for @code{tlmgr} needs Perl/Tk to be installed.
For Windows the necessary modules are shipped within TeX Live, for all
other (i.e., Unix-based) systems Perl/Tk (as well as Perl of course) has
to be installed.  @url{http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk} has a
list of invocations for some distros.

When started with @code{tlmgr gui} the graphical user interface will be
shown.  The main window contains a menu bar, the main display, and a
status area where messages normally shown on the console are displayed.

Within the main display there are three main parts: the @code{Display
configuration} area, the list of packages, and the action buttons.

Also, at the top right the currently loaded repository is shown; this
also acts as a button and when clicked will try to load the default
repository.  To load a different repository, see the @code{tlmgr} menu item.

Finally, the status area at the bottom of the window gives additional
information about what is going on.

@menu
* tlmgr Main display::
* tlmgr Menu bar::
@end menu

@node tlmgr Main display
@appendixsubsec Main display

@menu
* tlmgr Display configuration area::
* tlmgr Package list area::
* tlmgr Main display action buttons::
@end menu

@node tlmgr Display configuration area
@appendixsubsubsec Display configuration area

The first part of the main display allows you to specify (filter) which
packages are shown.  By default, all are shown.  Changes here are
reflected right away.

@table @asis
@item Status
@anchor{tlmgr Status}

Select whether to show all packages (the default), only those installed,
only those @emph{not} installed, or only those with update available.

@item Category
@anchor{tlmgr Category}

Select which categories are shown: packages, collections, and/or
schemes.  These are briefly explained in the @ref{tlmgr DESCRIPTION,, DESCRIPTION} section
above.

@item Match
@anchor{tlmgr Match}

Select packages matching for a specific pattern.  By default, this uses
the same algorithm as @code{tlmgr search}, i.e., searches everything:
descriptions, taxonomies, and/or filenames.  You can also select any
subset for searching.

@item Selection
@anchor{tlmgr Selection}

Select packages to those selected, those not selected, or all.  Here,
``selected'' means that the checkbox in the beginning of the line of a
package is ticked.

@item Display configuration buttons
@anchor{tlmgr Display configuration buttons}

To the right there are three buttons: select all packages, select none
(a.k.a. deselect all), and reset all these filters to the defaults,
i.e., show all available.

@end table

@node tlmgr Package list area
@appendixsubsubsec Package list area

The second are of the main display lists all installed packages.  If a
repository is loaded, those that are available but not installed are
also listed.

Double clicking on a package line pops up an informational window with
further details: the long description, included files, etc.

Each line of the package list consists of the following items:

@table @asis
@item a checkbox
@anchor{tlmgr a checkbox}

Used to select particular packages; some of the action buttons (see
below) work only on the selected packages.

@item package name
@anchor{tlmgr package name}

The name (identifier) of the package as given in the database.

@item local revision (and version)
@anchor{tlmgr local revision (and version)}

If the package is installed the TeX Live revision number for the
installed package will be shown.  If there is a catalogue version given
in the database for this package, it will be shown in parentheses.
However, the catalogue version, unlike the TL revision, is not
guaranteed to reflect what is actually installed.

@item remote revision (and version)
@anchor{tlmgr remote revision (and version)}

If a repository has been loaded the revision of the package in the
repository (if present) is shown.  As with the local column, if a
catalogue version is provided it will be displayed.  And also as with
the local column, the catalogue version may be stale.

@item short description
@anchor{tlmgr short description}

The short description of the package.

@end table

@node tlmgr Main display action buttons
@appendixsubsubsec Main display action buttons

Below the list of packages are several buttons:

@table @asis
@item Update all installed
@anchor{tlmgr Update all installed}

This calls @code{tlmgr update --all}, i.e., tries to update all available
packages.  Below this button is a toggle to allow reinstallation of
previously removed packages as part of this action.

The other four buttons only work on the selected packages, i.e., those
where the checkbox at the beginning of the package line is ticked.

@item Update
@anchor{tlmgr Update}

Update only the selected packages.

@item Install
@anchor{tlmgr Install}

Install the selected packages; acts like @code{tlmgr install}, i.e., also
installs dependencies.  Thus, installing a collection installs all its
constituent packages.

@item Remove
@anchor{tlmgr Remove}

Removes the selected packages; acts like @code{tlmgr remove}, i.e., it will
also remove dependencies of collections (but not dependencies of normal
packages).

@item Backup
@anchor{tlmgr Backup}

Makes a backup of the selected packages; acts like @code{tlmgr backup}. This
action needs the option @code{backupdir} set (see @code{Options -} General>).

@end table

@node tlmgr Menu bar
@appendixsubsec Menu bar

The following entries can be found in the menu bar:

@table @asis
@item @code{tlmgr} menu
@anchor{tlmgr @code{tlmgr} menu}

The items here load various repositories: the default as specified in
the TeX Live database, the default network repository, the repository
specified on the command line (if any), and an arbitrarily
manually-entered one.  Also has the so-necessary @code{quit} operation.

@item @code{Options menu}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{Options menu}}

Provides access to several groups of options: @code{Paper} (configuration of
default paper sizes), @code{Platforms} (only on Unix, configuration of the
supported/installed platforms), @code{GUI Language} (select language used in
the GUI interface), and @code{General} (everything else).

Several toggles are also here.  The first is @code{Expert options}, which is
set by default.  If you turn this off, the next time you start the GUI a
simplified screen will be shown that display only the most important
functionality.  This setting is saved in the configuration file of
@code{tlmgr}; see @ref{tlmgr CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR,, CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR} for details.

The other toggles are all off by default: for debugging output, to
disable the automatic installation of new packages, and to disable the
automatic removal of packages deleted from the server.  Playing with the
choices of what is or isn't installed may lead to an inconsistent TeX Live
installation; e.g., when a package is renamed.

@item @code{Actions menu}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{Actions menu}}

Provides access to several actions: update the filename database (aka
@code{ls-R}, @code{mktexlsr}, @code{texhash}), rebuild all formats (@code{fmtutil-sys
--all}), update the font map database (@code{updmap-sys}), restore from a backup
of a package, and use of symbolic links in system directories (not on
Windows).

The final action is to remove the entire TeX Live installation (also not
on Windows).

@item @code{Help menu}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{Help menu}}

Provides access to the TeX Live manual (also on the web at
@url{http://tug.org/texlive/doc.html}) and the usual ``About'' box.

@end table

@node tlmgr MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT
@appendixsec MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT

With the @code{--machine-readable} option, @code{tlmgr} writes to stdout in the
fixed line-oriented format described here, and the usual informational
messages for human consumption are written to stderr (normally they are
written to stdout).  The idea is that a program can get all the
information it needs by reading stdout.

Currently this option only applies to the 
@ref{tlmgr update [@emph{option}]... [@emph{pkg}]..., update, update},
@ref{tlmgr install [@emph{option}]... @emph{pkg}..., install, install}, and
@ref{tlmgr option,, option} actions.  

@menu
* tlmgr Machine-readable @code{update} and @code{install} output::
* tlmgr Machine-readable @code{option} output::
@end menu

@node tlmgr Machine-readable @code{update} and @code{install} output
@appendixsubsec Machine-readable @code{update} and @code{install} output

The output format is as follows:

@verbatim
  fieldname "\t" value
  ...
  "end-of-header"
  pkgname status localrev serverrev size runtime esttot
  ...
  "end-of-updates"
  other output from post actions, not in machine readable form
@end verbatim

The header section currently has two fields: @code{location-url} (the
repository source from which updates are being drawn), and
@code{total-bytes} (the total number of bytes to be downloaded).

The @emph{localrev} and @emph{serverrev} fields for each package are the
revision numbers in the local installation and server repository,
respectively.  The @emph{size} field is the number of bytes to be
downloaded, i.e., the size of the compressed tar file for a network
installation, not the unpacked size. The runtime and esttot fields 
are only present for updated and auto-install packages, and contain
the currently passed time since start of installation/updates
and the estimated total time.

Line endings may be either LF or CRLF depending on the current platform.

@table @asis
@item @code{location-url} @emph{location}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{location-url} @emph{location}}

The @emph{location} may be a url (including @code{file:///foo/bar/...}), or a
directory name (@code{/foo/bar}).  It is the package repository from which
the new package information was drawn.

@item @code{total-bytes} @emph{count}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{total-bytes} @emph{count}}

The @emph{count} is simply a decimal number, the sum of the sizes of all the
packages that need updating or installing (which are listed subsequently).

@end table

Then comes a line with only the literal string @code{end-of-header}.

Each following line until a line with literal string @code{end-of-updates}
reports on one package.  The fields on
each line are separated by a tab.  Here are the fields.

@table @asis
@item @emph{pkgname}
@anchor{tlmgr @emph{pkgname}}

The TeX Live package identifier, with a possible platform suffix for
executables.  For instance, @code{pdftex} and @code{pdftex.i386-linux} are given
as two separate packages, one on each line.

@item @emph{status}
@anchor{tlmgr @emph{status}}

The status of the package update.  One character, as follows:

@table @asis
@item @code{d}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{d}}

The package was removed on the server.

@item @code{f}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{f}}

The package was removed in the local installation, even though a
collection depended on it.  (E.g., the user ran @code{tlmgr remove
--force}.)

@item @code{u}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{u}}

Normal update is needed.

@item @code{r}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{r}}

Reversed non-update: the locally-installed version is newer than the
version on the server.

@item @code{a}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{a}}

Automatically-determined need for installation, the package is new on
the server and is (most probably) part of an installed collection.

@item @code{i}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{i}}

Package will be installed and isn't present in the local installation
(action install).

@item @code{I}
@anchor{tlmgr @code{I}}

Package is already present but will be reinstalled (action install).

@end table

@item @emph{localrev}
@anchor{tlmgr @emph{localrev}}

The revision number of the installed package, or @code{-} if it is not
present locally.

@item @emph{serverrev}
@anchor{tlmgr @emph{serverrev}}

The revision number of the package on the server, or @code{-} if it is not
present on the server.

@item @emph{size}
@anchor{tlmgr @emph{size}}

The size in bytes of the package on the server.  The sum of all the
package sizes is given in the @code{total-bytes} header field mentioned above.

@item @emph{runtime}
@anchor{tlmgr @emph{runtime}}

The run time since start of installations or updates.

@item @emph{esttot}
@anchor{tlmgr @emph{esttot}}

The estimated total time.

@end table

@node tlmgr Machine-readable @code{option} output
@appendixsubsec Machine-readable @code{option} output

The output format is as follows:

@verbatim
  key "\t" value
@end verbatim

If a value is not saved in the database the string @code{(not set)} is shown.

If you are developing a program that uses this output, and find that
changes would be helpful, do not hesitate to write the mailing list.
