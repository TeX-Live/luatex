This directory libs/dummy does not build or install anything.  Its purpose
is to record the command line used to invoke libs/dummy/configure from
libs/configure.  This information is then used by libs/Makefile to invoke
libs/*/configure in the remaining subdirectories without the need to adjust
any absolute or relative paths.
