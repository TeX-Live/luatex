	Building GNU MP as part of the TL tree
	======================================

This directory libs/gmp/ uses a proxy Makefile.am to build the GNU MP
library 'libgmp' from the unmodified source tree in
libs/gmp/gmp-src/, bypassing the original build system.

As far as applicable, the tests in libs/gmp/gmp-src/configure have
been translated into equivalent test in libs/gmp/configure.ac.

=============================

At the moment there is a wrapper Makefile.am and configure.ac.
