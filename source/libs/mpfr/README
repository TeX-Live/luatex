	Building GNU MPFR as part of the TL tree
	========================================

This directory libs/mpfr/ uses a proxy Makefile.am to build the GNU MPFR
library 'libmpfr' from the unmodified source tree in libs/mpfr/mpfr-src/,
bypassing the original build system.

As far as applicable, the tests in libs/mpfr/mpfr-src/configure have been
translated into equivalent test in libs/mpfr/configure.ac.
