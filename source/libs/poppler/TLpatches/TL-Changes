Changes applied to the poppler-0.62.0 tree as obtained from:
	http://poppler.freedesktop.org/

Removed unused dirs:
	cmake cpp glib m4 qt4 qt5 test utils

General idea:
update version.ac
mv poppler-src poppler-prev
tar xf poppler-*.tar.gz
mv poppler-0.62.0 poppler-src
cd poppler-src
svn status >/tmp/s
svn add # the ? lines
svn remove # the ! lines
# adapt Makefile.am for new files
# adapt configure.ac as needed
autoreconf
make -C .../Work/libs/poppler/
# until it succeeds
# try build of everything, luatex/xetex may need updating.
