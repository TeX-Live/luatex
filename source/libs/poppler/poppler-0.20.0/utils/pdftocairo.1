.SH NAME
pdftocairo \- Portable Document Format (PDF) to PNG/JPEG/PDF/PS/EPS/SVG using cairo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdftocairo
[options]
.IR PDF-file
.RI [ output-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pdftocairo
converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files, using the cairo output device of the poppler PDF library, to any of the following output formats:
.IP \(bu
Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
.IP \(bu
JPEG Interchange Format (JPEG)
.IP \(bu
Portable Document Format (PDF)
.IP \(bu
PostScript (PS)
.IP \(bu
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)
.IP \(bu
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
.PP
.B pdftocairo
reads the PDF file,
.IR PDF-file ,
and writes to
.IR output-file .
The image formats (PNG and JPEG) generate one file per page with the page number and file type appended to
.IR output-file
(except when \-singlefile is used).
When the output format is a vector format (PDF, PS, EPS, and SVG) or when \-singlefile is used,
.IR output-file
is the full filename.

If the
.IR PDF-file
is \*(lq\-\*(rq , the PDF is read from stdin.
If the
.IR output-file
is \*(lq\-\*(rq , the output file will be written to stdout. Using stdout is not valid with image formats unless \-singlefile is used.
If
.IR output-file
is not used, the output filename will be derived from the
.IR PDF-file
filename.
.PP
Not all options are valid with all output formats. One (and only one) of the output format options (\-png, \-jpeg, \-pdf, \-ps, \-eps, or \-svg) must be used.
.PP
The resolution options (\-r, \-rx, \-ry) set the resolution of the
image output formats. The image dimensions will depend on the PDF page
size and the resolution. For the vector outputs, regions of the page
that can not be represented natively in the output format (eg
translucency in PS) will be rasterized at the resolution specified by
the resolution options.
.PP
The \-scale-to options may be used to set a fixed image size. The
image resolution will vary with the page size.
.PP
The cropping options (\-x, \-y, \-W, and \-H) use units of pixels with
the image formats and PostScript points (1/72 inch) with the vector
formats. When cropping is used with vector output the cropped region is
centered unless \-nocenter is used in which case the cropped region is
at the top left (SVG) or bottom left (PDF, PS, EPS).

.TP
.BI \-jpeg
Generates a JPEG file(s)
.TP
.BI \-pdf
Generates a PDF file
.TP
.BI \-ps
Generate a PS file
.TP
.BI \-eps
Generate an EPS file. An EPS file contains a single image, so if you
use this option with a multi-page PDF file, you must use \-f and \-l
to specify a single page.  The page size options (\-origpagesizes,
\-paper, \-paperw, \-paperh) can not be used with this option.
.TP
.BI \-svg
Generate a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file
.TP
.BI \-f " number"
Specifies the first page to convert.
.TP
.BI \-l " number"
Specifies the last page to convert.
.TP
.B \-o
Generates only the odd numbered pages.
.TP
.B \-e
Generates only the even numbered pages.
.TP
.BI \-singlefile
Writes only the first page and does not add digits.
.TP
.BI \-r " number"
Specifies the X and Y resolution, in pixels per inch of image files (or rasterized regions in vector output). The default is 150 PPI.
.TP
.BI \-rx " number"
Specifies the X resolution, in pixels per inch of image files (or rasterized regions in vector output). The default is 150 PPI.
.TP
.BI \-ry " number"
Specifies the Y resolution, in pixels per inch of image files (or rasterized regions in vector output). The default is 150 PPI.
.TP
.BI \-scale-to " number"
Scales the long side of each page (width for landscape pages, height
for portrait pages) to fit in scale-to pixels. The size of the short
side will be determined by the aspect ratio of the page (PNG/JPEG only).
.TP
.BI \-scale-to-x " number"
Scales each page horizontally to fit in scale-to-x pixels. If
scale-to-y is set to -1, the vertical size will determined by the
aspect ratio of the page (PNG/JPEG only).
.TP
.BI \-scale-to-y " number"
Scales each page vertically to fit in scale-to-y pixels. If scale-to-x
is set to -1, the horizontal size will determined by the aspect ratio
of the page (PNG/JPEG only).
.TP
.BI \-x " number"
Specifies the x-coordinate of the crop area top left corner in pixels (image output) or points (vector output)
.TP
.BI \-y " number"
Specifies the y-coordinate of the crop area top left corner in pixels (image output) or points (vector output)
.TP
.BI \-W " number"
Specifies the width of crop area in pixels (image output) or points (vector output)  (default is 0)
.TP
.BI \-H " number"
Specifies the height of crop area in pixels (image output) or points (vector output)  (default is 0)
.TP
.BI \-sz " number"
Specifies the size of crop square in pixels (image output) or points (vector output)  (sets \-W and \-H)
.TP
.B \-cropbox
Uses the crop box rather than media box when generating the files
.TP
.B \-mono
Generate a monochrome file (PNG only).
.TP
.B \-gray
Generate a grayscale file (PNG and JPEG only).
.TP
.B \-transp
Use a transparent page color instead of white (PNG only).
.TP
.BI \-icc " icc-file"
Use the specified ICC file as the output profile (PNG only). The profile will be embedded in the PNG file.
.TP
.B \-level2
Generate Level 2 PostScript (PS only).
.TP
.B \-level3
Generate Level 3 PostScript (PS only). This enables all Level 2 features plus
shading patterns and masked images. This is the default setting.
.TP
.B \-origpagesizes
Generate a file with variable page sizes and orientations (PS and PDF
only). The size of each page will be the original page in the PDF
file.  If the output is PS the file will contain %%DocumentMedia and
%%PageMedia DSC comments specifying the size of each page.  Any
specification of the page size via \-paper, \-paperw, or \-paperh will
get overridden as long as each page of the PDF file has a defined
paper size.
.TP
.BI \-paper " size"
Set the paper size to one of "letter", "legal", "A4", or "A3"
(PS,PDF,SVG only).  This can also be set to "match", which will set
the paper size to match the size specified in the PDF
file. \-origpagesizes overrides this setting if the PDF file has
defined page sizes.
.TP
.BI \-paperw " size"
Set the paper width, in points (PS,PDF,SVG only). \-origpagesizes overrides this setting
if the PDF file has defined page sizes.
.TP
.BI \-paperh " size"
Set the paper height, in points (PS,PDF,SVG only). \-origpagesizes overrides this setting
if the PDF file has defined page sizes.
.TP
.B \-nocrop
By default, output is cropped to the CropBox specified in the PDF
file.  This option disables cropping.
.TP
.B \-expand
Expand PDF pages smaller than the paper to fill the paper (PS,PDF,SVG only).  By
default, these pages are not scaled.
.TP
.B \-noshrink
Don't scale PDF pages which are larger than the paper (PS,PDF,SVG only).  By default,
pages larger than the paper are shrunk to fit.
.TP
.B \-nocenter
By default, PDF pages smaller than the paper (after any scaling) are
centered on the paper.  This option causes them to be aligned to the
lower-left corner of the paper instead (PS,PDF,SVG only).
.TP
.B \-duplex
Adds the %%IncludeFeature: *Duplex DuplexNoTumble DSC comment to the
PostScript file (PS only).  This tells the print manager to enable duplexing.
.TP
.BI \-opw " password"
Specify the owner password for the PDF file.  Providing this will
bypass all security restrictions.
.TP
.BI \-upw " password"
Specify the user password for the PDF file.
.TP
.B \-q
Don't print any messages or errors.
.TP
.B \-v

.TP
.B \-h
Print usage information.
.RB ( \-help
and
