This directory texk/dummy does not build or install anything.  Its purpose
is to record the command line used to invoke texk/dummy/configure from
texk/configure.  This information is then used by texk/Makefile to invoke
texk/*/configure in the remaining subdirectories without the need to adjust
any absolute or relative paths.
