source/texk/texlive/linked_scripts
==================================
This directory contains copies of the scripts that are shipped within
TeX Live.  See more discussion, rationale, etc., in ./Makefile.am.

Steps to add a new script (take your time, do it right):

* svn mkdir the directory with the package name, and add the script

* add the dir/script-name to Makefile.am in the respective section
  (shell vs general interpreter, texmf vs texmf-dist)

* add the package/script to ctan2tds so that is found and installed
  automatically (%specialscripts), etc.

* get ctan2tl to run properly

* cd .. && autoreconf -v
  But only commit the results of this last if you have the same version
  of GNU m4, libtool, autoconf, automake, etc., installed that were
  already used (generally the latest official releases).  And if you
  have installed the original versions straight from ftp.gnu.org for
  yourself -- don't use versions from distro packages.

* make -C BLD/texk/texlive/linked_scripts scripts-list
  where BLD is the build tree, to update the file scripts.lst in the
  source tree (or manually update that file).
