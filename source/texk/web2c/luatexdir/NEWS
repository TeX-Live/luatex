-------------------------------------------------
pdfTeX 3.141592-1.30.0 was released on 2005-08-01
-------------------------------------------------
- pdfxtex (introduced with 1.20a) is gone; all extensions are now in pdf(e)tex.
- Some primitives have been renamed; the old names will still work, but are
  deprecated and some give a warning that they are obsolete:
    \pdfoptionpdfminorversion         -> \pdfminorversion
    \pdfoptionalwaysusepdfpagebox     -> \pdfforcepagebox
    \pdfoptionpdfinclusionerrorlevel  -> \pdfinclusionerrorlevel
- pdftex knows two new units:
  - new Didot (1nd=0.375mm)
  - new Cicero (1nc=12nd)
- New primitives: 
  - Inclusion of pngs has been greatly improved: It now does
    - alpha channel and transparency (only if %!PDF >=1.4)
    - 16-bit colour (only if %!PDF >=1.5); this must be enabled by setting
      \pdfimagehicolor to 1.
    - gamma correction; this must be enabled by setting \pdfimageapplygamma to
      1. The device gamma is taken from \pdfgamma. If no embedded value can be
      found in the png image, then the value of \pdfimagegamma is used instead.
    - fast direct embedding of png streams, if their structure allows this; the
      automatic fall-back is to decompress and re-compress as before.
  - pdfTeX now has an interface to the precise system time (if available) as an
    aid in benchmarking TeX macro code. 
    - \pdfelapsedtime is a read-only integer that (initially) returns the
      amount of time passed since the start of this run. This amount is given
      in `scaled seconds': the value 65536 counts as one second. If more time
      has passed than 32767 seconds, (2^31)-1 will be returned.
    - \pdfresettimer updates the internal timer, such that subsequent calls to
      \pdfelapsedtime will restart from 0.
  - pdfTeX can now generate random numbers:
    - \pdfuniformdeviate <count> generates a uniformly distributed random
      integer value between 0 (inclusive) and <count> (exclusive).
    - \pdfnormaldeviate expands to a random integer value with a mean of 0 and
      a unit of 65536. 
    - \pdfrandomseed allows access to the current seed value.
    - \pdfsetrandomseed <count> sets the random seed to a specific value.
  - \pdfnoligatures\f disables ligatures for the loaded font \f.
  - Escaping strings:
    - \pdfescapestring{<a>} escapes the string <a> so that it can be used as
      PDF string.
    - \pdfescapename{<a>} escapes the string <a> so that it can be used as PDF
      name.
    - \pdfescapehex{<a>} converts the string <a> to uppercase hexadecimal
      representation.
    - \pdfunescapehex{<b>} reverses the effect of \pdfescapehex
  - \pdfcreationdate expands to the date string that pdfTeX uses in the info
    dict as default.
  - \pdffilemoddate{<file>} expands to the modification date of <file> in the
    same format as \pdfcreationdate (PDF date format).
  - \pdffilesize{<file>} expands to the size of <file> as string.
  - \pdfmdfivesum{<abc>} or \pdfmdfivesum file {<file>} calculates the md5
    sum (of a string or a file) and converts it to uppercase hexadecimal format
    (same as \pdfescapehex).
  - \pdffiledump [offset <int>] [length <int>] <general text>
    Expands to a hex dump of the file given in <general text>, starting at
    given offset or 0 with given length.
  - \pdfshellescape is a read-only integer that is 1 if \write18 is enabled, 0
    otherwise.
  - \pdfxformname <object number>, which expands to the number in the
    corresponding form XObject name.
  - \leftmarginkern <box number> and \rightmarginkern <box number> tell the
    margin kern at the left and right side of the horizontal list stored in box
    <box number>.
  - \pdfpkmode is a token register that sets the MF mode for pixel font
    generation. The contents of this register is dumped into the format, so one
    can (optionally) preset it e.g. in part of pdftexconfig.tex.
  - \pdftracingfonts: An integer variable controlling the tracing of font
    expansion. It is zero by default; then we get a log (with fontexpansion)
    like this
    ...\tenrm t
    ...\tenrm (+20) e
    Without font expansion, this default should be compatible with TeX's
    original log output.
    If \pdftracingfonts is set to 1 (or greater), we get a more verbose log:
    ...\xivtt (cmtt10@14.0pt) t
    ...\xivtt (cmtt10+20@14.0pt) e
    See also bug 304.
- New experimental primitives:
  - \pdfmatch [icase] [subcount <number>}] {<pattern>}{<string>}
    Implements pattern matching using the POSIX regex.
    It returns the same values as \pdfstrcmp, but with the following semantics: 
      -1: error case (invalid pattern, ...)
       0: no match
       1: match found
    Options:
    * icase: case insensitive matching
    * subcount: it sets the table size for found subpatterns.
      A number "-1" resets the table size to the start default.
  - \pdflastmatch <number>
    The result of \pdfmatch is stored in an array. The entry "0" contains the
    match, the following entries submatches. The positions of the matches are
    also available. They are encoded:
      <position> "->" <match string>
    The position "-1" with an empty string indicates that this entry is not
    set.
  - \pdfstrcmp{<a>}{<b>} compares two strings and returns the strings "0" if
    <a> equals <b>, "-1" if <a> is less than <b>, "1" if <a> is greater than
    <b>
- The primitive \pdfmovechars has been removed (bug 294)
- Bugfixes:
  - empty strings are not supressed anymore (bug 335)
  - \unhboxing and character protusion didn't work well together (bug 292)
  - --jobname didn't work if there was no filename at all (bug 302)
  - Some problem with fonts on solaris (bug 315)
  - Dangling font objects with non-replacable fonts (bug 311).
  - \pdfxform didn't work with box>255 (bug 310)
  - cmap: unicode ???? is mapped to multiple glyphs (bug 306).
- pdfTeX uses zlib 1.2.3

      representing a ColorSpace object
    - \pdfstrcmp compares two strings
    - \pdfescapestring/\pdflastescapedstring provide a way to escape string
    - \pdffirstlineheight/\pdflastlinedepth/\pdfeachlineheight/\pdfeachlinedepth

        - quitvmode patch

------------------------------------------------
pdfTeX 3.141592-1.20b was released on 2004-12-22
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed some minor bugs, mostly with hz
- The info line "output format initialized to PDF/DVI" isn't shown anymore, as
  this info wasn't reliable (bug 112).
- Now the PDF-related statistics (PDF objects...) in the .log file is only
  shown in PDF output mode. It start with a line "PDF statistics:".
- \pdfimageresolution is not limited to 2400 [dpi] anymore, can now be between
  0 and 65535 [dpi].
- pdfTeX uses xpdf 3.00pl2
- pdfTeX uses libpng 1.2.8, which fixes some png-related bugs.

------------------------------------------------
pdfTeX 3.141592-1.20a was released on 2004-09-06
------------------------------------------------
- There is a new program pdfxtex, which contains experimental features which
  might end up in pdftex in the future.
- Most distributions now use eTeX as the default engine, so when you call
  pdftex you will get pdfeTeX. Most distributions now also use pdfTeX as the
  default engine, so when you call latex you will get pdfeTeX running LaTeX.:-)
- We are setting up pdfTeX as a project at sarovar
  (http://sarovar.org/projects/pdftex/). Please report bugs etc. through the
  site.
- Support for the file pdftex.cfg is gone completely. All parameters that had
  previously been set by it can be set through primitives; their values are
  dumped to the format file.
- The searchpath for encoding and mapfiles has been changed.
  See http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2004-January/004734.html and
  http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2004-January/004791.html
- eTeX is now version 2.2, incorporating the last changes to TeX (3.141592).
- New options for \pdfmapfile:
  General functionality: Map items (map files, new: also single map lines; see
  \pdfmapline) are put in list of pending map items. During the next shipout,
  pending map items are sequentially scanned for their map entries, and an
  internal map entry database is updated, using the modes below. Then the list
  of pending map items is cleared. Map entries of fonts already in use are left
  untouched. New: All \pdfmapfile and \pdfmapline commands can also be given
  after shipout of the first page.
  - \pdfmapfile {foo.map} clears the list of pending map items and starts a new
    list with the only pending file foo.map. When the map entry lines of
    foo.map are scanned, duplicate map entries are ignored and a warning is
    issued. This is the old behaviour.
  - \pdfmapfile {+foo.map} puts foo.map in the list of pending map items. When
    the map entry lines of foo.map are scanned, duplicate map entries are
    ignored and a warning is issued.
  - \pdfmapfile {=foo.map} puts foo.map in the list of pending map items. When
    foo.map is scanned, matching map entries in database are replaced by new
    entries from foo.map.
  - \pdfmapfile {-foo.map} puts foo.map in the list of pending map items. When
    foo.map is scanned, matching map entries are deleted from database.
  - \pdfmapfile {} clears the list of pending map items. It does not affect map
    entries already registered into the database. This is the old behaviour.
- New command \pdfmapline {line}. It's like \pdfmapfile but here you can set
  single map lines like in the map files directly. The modifiers (+-=) have the
  same effect as with \pdfmapfile.
- Simplified the handling of the 14 Type 1 "standard fonts" (Times,
  Helvetica...): They are now more or less handled like any other Type 1 font.
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2004-July/000648.html
- hz: So far the font expansion feature required that the user must be able to
  create expanded tfms (eg cmr10+10.tfm). Now font expansion can be used
  without creating these tfms.
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2004-May/000504.html
- hz: Changed \pdffontexpand primitive --> the expand factor is now fixed to
  1000 and the argument is ignored. This will lead to spurious texts of "1000"
  in your output if you compile old documents.
- New command \pdftexbanner which returns a string with the full banner of the
  current binary (e.g. "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592-1.20a (Web2C 7.5.3)
  kpathsea version 3.5.3")
- The PTEX.FullBanner key is now inserted in the document info dict instead of
  the catalog. Newer versions of Acrobat display it.
- Now includes support for encTeX.
- Extended \pdfannot to use reserveobjnum/useobjnum 
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2004-March/000424.html
- Bugfix: pdfTeX would read an .xpdfrc when including pdfs.
  See http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2004-March/004835.html
- Bugfix: The strings in /ID would sometimes be empty.
- Bugfix: Even when mapfiles or encodings or PostScript font files were
  missing, pdfTeX still produced a (most often corrupt) pdf. Now it aborts with
  an error in these cases.
- numerous small bugfixes.
- pdfTeX now uses the GNU libavl from Ben Pfaff for managing of fontmap
  entries.
- pdfTeX uses zlib 1.2.1
- pdfTeX uses xpdf 3.00
- pdfTeX uses libpng 1.2.7
  
------------------------------------------------
pdfTeX 3.141592-1.11b was released on 2003-10-06
------------------------------------------------
- Bugfix: The handling of /Rotate produced displaced images when /Rotate was 90
  or 270.

------------------------------------------------
pdfTeX 3.141592-1.11a was released on 2003-08-02
------------------------------------------------
- New command \pdftrailer analogue to \pdfcatalog whose argument ends up in the
  trailer dictionary.
- The behaviour when an included pdf has a newer version than the one specified
  with \pdfoptionpdfminorversion can be controlled by the new internal integer
  \pdfoptionpdfinclusionerrorlevel: If it's 0, pdfTeX gives only a warning; if
  it's 1, it raises an error. 
    This can also be set in pdftex.cfg with pdf_inclusion_errorlevel
- The syntax for outlines has been extended to allow attributes:
  <outline spec> --> <attr spec> <action spec> [count <number>] <general text>
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2003-June/000165.html
- The syntax of \pdfobj has been extended:
  \pdfobj <object type spec>                              (h, v, m)
  <object type spec> --> reserveobjnum
                       | [useobjnum <number>] [<attr spec>] [stream [<attr spec>]] <object contents>
  <object contents> --> <file spec>
                      | <general text>
  When the optional keyword `reserveobjnum' and `useobjnum' is not given, the
  behaviour is unchanged. 
  See also http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/pdftex/2003-March/003814.html
- Bugfix: /CreationDate didn't care for the timezone and could be fooled.
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2003-July/000223.html
- Bugfix: The translation of 8-bit characters in included pdfs that had their
  eighth bit set sometimes got wrong because of a missing typecast.
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2003-July/000216.html
- Bugfix: pdfTeX -ini would crash with a minimal file because it didn't read
  it's config and so didn't know anything about fonts.
  See http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-July/004262.html
- Bugfix: \pdfstartlink would produce spurious /NewWindow entries. Also the
  syntax of <action spec> and <goto-action spec> has been cleaned up.
  See http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-pdftex/2003-June/000167.html 
- Bugfix: \pdffontattr was not used for T3 fonts.
  See http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-June/004127.html
- Bugfix: The cropbox of an included pdf would sometimes not be used.
  See http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-May/004037.html
- pdfTeX uses xpdf 2.02

------------------------------------------------
pdfTeX 3.141592-1.10b was released on 2003-02-26
------------------------------------------------
- The numbers in transformation matrices are allways written with maximum
  precision (see http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-February/003596.html).
- Incorporated the new version of TeX: 3.141592
- Bugfix: Numbers in pdfs would sometimes be just a wee bit of (changed
  implementation of pdftoepdf.convertNumToPDF).
- Bugfix: When setting the /Producer, /Creator or /CreationDate keys with
  /pdfinfo pdfTeX would also insert default values which caused duplicate keys
  in the info dict (see
  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-February/003524.html).
- The reading of mapfiles is much faster (see
  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2002-July/002843.html).
- Bugfix: AR5 had problems with the CTM when displaying in "fit visible" mode
  (see http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2002-May/002688.html).
- Bugfix: str_in_str had wrong indices (see
  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2002-March/002367.html).
- Bugfix: decimal_digits defaulted to 0, which caused problems with included
  images when including pdfs (see
  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-February/003518.html). 
  It now defaults to 4.
- Bugfix: the type of included images was decided based only on the extensions;
  now pdfTeX looks for magic bytes at the start of files (see
  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2003-February/003519.html)

-----------------------------------------------
pdfTeX 3.14159-1.10a was released on 2003-01-16
-----------------------------------------------
- pdfTeX is now able to produce pdf1.4 (which is also the default) and has
  almost complete support for including pdf1.4 files:
  - Additional attributes like MetaData are copied from included pdfs.
  - Currently the Page Group attribute (see sections 7.3.6 and 7.5.5 of the pdf
    1.4 reference) of included pdfs is NOT copied (as we don't know how to
    handle this when imposing pdfs). 
      This means including pdfs with transparency features will work as long as
    the included pdf doesn't use Page Groups; if it does, the result might not
    be what is expected (One application known to use Page Groups is Adobe
    Illustrator v9++). The distributed pdfTeX binaries will give a warning
    about any occurance of a Page Group in an included pdf and ignore the Page
    Group (thus producing syntactically correct pdfs but probably not the
    intended output).  
      Acrobat 5++ and newer versions of Jaws display files without Page Groups
    correctly, so this might not really be a problem.  
      See pdftoepdf.cc for preprocessor flags which allow this behaviour to be
    changed (copying the Page Group (most likely producing incorrect pdf) or
    treating Page Groups as errors).
- The new primitive \pdfoptionpdfminorversion sets the pdf version of the
  generated file and the latest allowed pdf version of included pdfs:
        \pdfoptionpdfminorversion=3
  tells pdfTeX to set the pdf version to 1.3 and allows only included pdfs with
  versions <= 1.3 . 
    The default for \pdfoptionpdfminorversion is 4 for pdf 1.4
    This must appear before any data is written to the generated pdf file, so
  you should put it at the very start of your files.
    This can also be set in pdftex.cfg with pdf_minorversion
- It is now possible to specify the pdf page box to use when including pdfs.
  The syntax has been extended:
    \pdfximage [<image attr spec>] <general text>           (h, v, m)
    <image attr spec> --> [<rule spec>] [<attr spec>] [<page spec>] [<pdf box spec>]
    <pdf box spec> --> mediabox|cropbox|bleedbox|trimbox|artbox
  The default is cropbox (which defaults to mediabox), to be compatible with
  previous versions of pdfTeX.
    The page box specified at \pdfximage can be globally overridden with the
  config parameter always_use_pdfpagebox and the command
  \pdfoptionalwaysusepdfpagebox <integer>, where 0 is the default (use whatever
  is specified with \pdfximage), 1 is media, 2 is crop, 3 is bleed, 4 is trim
  and 5 is artbox. This can only be set once per object, i.e. the value used at
  \pdfximage is remembered.
    See the pdf reference for an explanation of the boxes.
- The support for the inclusion of jpeg images has been extended to allow the
  inclusion of JPEG/Exif files which are produced by digital photo cameras
  (thanks to Hartmut Henkel).
- The support for the inclusion of tif images has been removed as it was of
  limited use (it worked only for gray-scale and rgb images) and produced wrong
  results (all other images types where treated as rgb images). 
  Tif images can be converted on *nix on-the-fly to pngs with the help of
  ImageMagick, epstopdf.sty or pdftex.def v0.4 or newer, and this rule:
    \DeclareGraphicsRule{.tif}{png}{.png}{`convert #1 `basename #1 .tif`.png}
- The extensions for pdf encryption have been removed, since they make the
  pdfTeX code overly complex. Those needing pdf encryption are encouraged to
  produce a standalone program for encrypting pdfs.
- pdfTeX now writes a usage statistic about the pdfTeX specific memory to the
  log.
- numerous bugfixes, most of them in the inclusion of pdfs.
- pdfTeX uses xpdf 2.01
- pdfTeX uses libpng 1.2.5
