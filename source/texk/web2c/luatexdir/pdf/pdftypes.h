/* This stucture holds everything that is needed for the actual pdf generation.

Because this structure interfaces with C++, it is not wise to use |boolean|
here (C++ has a boolean type built-in that is not compatible). Also, I have
plans to convert the backend code into a C library for use with e.g. standalone
lua. Together, this means that it is best only to use the standard C types and
the types explicitly defined in this header, and stay away from types like 
|integer| and |eight_bits| that are used elsewhere in the \LUATEX\ sources.
