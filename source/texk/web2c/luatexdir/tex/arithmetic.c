/*
The principal computations performed by \TeX\ are done entirely in terms of
integers less than $2^{31}$ in magnitude; and divisions are done only when both
dividend and divisor are nonnegative. Thus, the arithmetic specified in this
program can be carried out in exactly the same way on a wide variety of
computers, including some small ones. Why? Because the arithmetic
calculations need to be spelled out precisely in order to guarantee that
\TeX\ will produce identical output on different machines. If some
quantities were rounded differently in different implementations, we would
find that line breaks and even page breaks might occur in different places.
Hence the arithmetic of \TeX\ has been designed with care, and systems that
claim to be implementations of \TeX82 should follow precisely the
@:TeX82}{\TeX82@>
calculations as they appear in the present program.

(Actually there are three places where \TeX\ uses |div| with a possibly negative
numerator. These are harmless; see |div| in the index. Also if the user
sets the \.{\\time} or the \.{\\year} to a negative value, some diagnostic
information will involve negative-numerator division. The same remarks
apply for |mod| as well as for |div|.)

@ Here is a routine that calculates half of an integer, using an
unambiguous convention with respect to signed odd numbers.

Conversely, here is a procedure analogous to |print_int|. If the output

|round_decimals| routine above, it turns out that the original value will
be reproduced exactly; the ``simplest'' such decimal number is output,
but there is always at least one digit following the decimal point.

The invariant relation in the \&{repeat} loop is that a sequence of
decimal digits yet to be printed will yield the original number if and only if
they form a fraction~$f$ in the range $s-\delta\L10\cdot2^{16}f<s$.
We can stop if and only if $f=0$ satisfies this condition; the loop will
terminate before $s$ can possibly become zero.

/*
Physical sizes that a \TeX\ user specifies for portions of documents are
represented internally as scaled points. Thus, if we define an `sp' (scaled
@^sp@>
point) as a unit equal to $2^{-16}$ printer's points, every dimension
inside of \TeX\ is an integer number of sp. There are exactly
4,736,286.72 sp per inch.  Users are not allowed to specify dimensions
larger than $2^{30}-1$ sp, which is a distance of about 18.892 feet (5.7583
meters); two such quantities can be added without overflow on a 32-bit
computer.

The present implementation of \TeX\ does not check for overflow when
@^overflow in arithmetic@>
dimensions are added or subtracted. This could be done by inserting a
few dozen tests of the form `\ignorespaces|if x>=@'10000000000 then
@t\\{report\_overflow}@>|', but the chance of overflow is so remote that
such tests do not seem worthwhile.

\TeX\ needs to do only a few arithmetic operations on scaled quantities,
other than addition and subtraction, and the following subroutines do most of
the work. A single computation might use several subroutine calls, and it is
desirable to avoid producing multiple error messages in case of arithmetic
overflow; so the routines set the global variable |arith_error| to |true|
instead of reporting errors directly to the user. Another global variable,
|tex_remainder|, holds the remainder after a division.

The next subroutine is used to compute the ``badness'' of glue, when a
total~|t| is supposed to be made from amounts that sum to~|s|.  According
to {\sl The \TeX book}, the badness of this situation is $100(t/s)^3$;
however, badness is simply a heuristic, so we need not squeeze out the
last drop of accuracy when computing it. All we really want is an
approximation that has similar properties.
@:TeXbook}{\sl The \TeX book@>

The actual method used to compute the badness is easier to read from the
program than to describe in words. It produces an integer value that is a
reasonably close approximation to $100(t/s)^3$, and all implementations
of \TeX\ should use precisely this method. Any badness of $2^{13}$ or more is
treated as infinitely bad, and represented by 10000.

It is not difficult to prove that $$\hbox{|badness(t+1,s)>=badness(t,s)
>=badness(t,s+1)|}.$$ The badness function defined here is capable of
computing at most 1095 distinct values, but that is plenty.

When \TeX\ ``packages'' a list into a box, it needs to calculate the
proportionality ratio by which the glue inside the box should stretch
or shrink. This calculation does not affect \TeX's decision making,
so the precise details of rounding, etc., in the glue calculation are not
of critical importance for the consistency of results on different computers.

We shall use the type |glue_ratio| for such proportionality ratios.
A glue ratio should take the same amount of memory as an
|integer| (usually 32 bits) if it is to blend smoothly with \TeX's
other data structures. Thus |glue_ratio| should be equivalent to
|short_real| in some implementations of \PASCAL. Alternatively,
it is possible to deal with glue ratios using nothing but fixed-point
arithmetic; see {\sl TUGboat \bf3},1 (March 1982), 10--27. (But the
routines cited there must be modified to allow negative glue ratios.)

/*

This section is (almost) straight from MetaPost. I had to change
the types (use |integer| instead of |fraction|), but that should
not have any influence on the actual calculations (the original
comments refer to quantities like |fraction_four| ($2^{30}$), and
that is the same as the numeric representation of |max_dimen|).

I've copied the low-level variables and routines that are needed, but
only those (e.g. |m_log|), not the accompanying ones like |m_exp|. Most
of the following low-level numeric routines are only needed within the
calculation of |norm_rand|. I've been forced to rename |make_fraction|
to |make_frac| because TeX already has a routine by that name with
a wholly different function (it creates a |fraction_noad| for math
typesetting) -- Taco

And now let's complete our collection of numeric utility routines
by considering random number generation.
\MP\ generates pseudo-random numbers with the additive scheme recommended
in Section 3.6 of {\sl The Art of Computer Programming}; however, the
results are random fractions between 0 and |fraction_one-1|, inclusive.

There's an auxiliary array |randoms| that contains 55 pseudo-random
fractions. Using the recurrence $x_n=(x_{n-55}-x_{n-31})\bmod 2^{28}$,
we generate batches of 55 new $x_n$'s at a time by calling |new_randoms|.
The global variable |j_random| tells which element has most recently
been consumed.
*/

static int randoms[55];         /* the last 55 random values generated */
static int j_random;            /* the number of unused |randoms| */

/*  A small bit of metafont is needed. */

#define fraction_half 01000000000       /* $2^{27}$, represents 0.50000000 */
#define fraction_one 02000000000        /* $2^{28}$, represents 1.00000000 */
#define fraction_four 010000000000      /* $2^{30}$, represents 4.00000000 */

/*
The |make_frac| routine produces the |fraction| equivalent of
|p/q|, given integers |p| and~|q|; it computes the integer
$f=\lfloor2^{28}p/q+{1\over2}\rfloor$, when $p$ and $q$ are
positive. If |p| and |q| are both of the same scaled type |t|,
the ``type relation'' |make_frac(t,t)=fraction| is valid;
and it's also possible to use the subroutine ``backwards,'' using
the relation |make_frac(t,fraction)=t| between scaled types.

If the result would have magnitude $2^{31}$ or more, |make_frac|
sets |arith_error:=true|. Most of \MP's internal computations have
been designed to avoid this sort of error.

If this subroutine were programmed in assembly language on a typical
machine, we could simply compute |(@t$2^{28}$@>*p)div q|, since a
double-precision product can often be input to a fixed-point division
instruction. But when we are restricted to \PASCAL\ arithmetic it
is necessary either to resort to multiple-precision maneuvering
or to use a simple but slow iteration. The multiple-precision technique
would be about three times faster than the code adopted here, but it
would be comparatively long and tricky, involving about sixteen
additional multiplications and divisions.

This operation is part of \MP's ``inner loop''; indeed, it will
consume nearly 10\pct! of the running time (exclusive of input and output)
if the code below is left unchanged. A machine-dependent recoding
will therefore make \MP\ run faster. The present implementation
is highly portable, but slow; it avoids multiplication and division
except in the initial stage. System wizards should be careful to
replace it with a routine that is guaranteed to produce identical
results in all cases.
@^system dependencies@>

As noted below, a few more routines should also be replaced by machine-dependent
code, for efficiency. But when a procedure is not part of the ``inner loop,''
such changes aren't advisable; simplicity and robustness are
preferable to trickery, unless the cost is too high.
