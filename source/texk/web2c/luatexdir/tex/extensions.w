@ The program above includes a bunch of ``hooks'' that allow further
capabilities to be added without upsetting \TeX's basic structure.
Most of these hooks are concerned with ``whatsit'' nodes, which are
intended to be used for special purposes; whenever a new extension to
\TeX\ involves a new kind of whatsit node, a corresponding change needs
to be made to the routines below that deal with such nodes,
but it will usually be unnecessary to make many changes to the
other parts of this program.

In order to demonstrate how extensions can be made, we shall treat
`\.{\\write}', `\.{\\openout}', `\.{\\closeout}', `\.{\\immediate}',
and `\.{\\special}' as if they were extensions.
These commands are actually primitives of \TeX, and they should
appear in all implementations of the system; but let's try to imagine
that they aren't. Then the program below illustrates how a person
could add them.

Sometimes, of course, an extension will require changes to \TeX\ itself;
no system of hooks could be complete enough for all conceivable extensions.
The features associated with `\.{\\write}' are almost all confined to the
following paragraphs, but there are small parts of the |print_ln| and
|print_char| procedures that were introduced specifically to \.{\\write}
characters. Furthermore one of the token lists recognized by the scanner
is a |write_text|; and there are a few other miscellaneous places where we
have already provided for some aspect of \.{\\write}.  The goal of a \TeX\
extender should be to minimize alterations to the standard parts of the
program, and to avoid them completely if possible. He or she should also
be quite sure that there's no easy way to accomplish the desired goals
with the standard features that \TeX\ already has. ``Think thrice before
extending,'' because that may save a lot of work, and it will also keep
incompatible extensions of \TeX\ from proliferating.
@^system dependencies@>
@^extensions to \TeX@>

First let's consider the format of whatsit nodes that are used to represent
the data associated with \.{\\write} and its relatives. Recall that a whatsit
has |type=whatsit_node|, and the |subtype| is supposed to distinguish
different kinds of whatsits. Each node occupies two or more words; the
exact number is immaterial, as long as it is readily determined from the
|subtype| or other data.

We shall introduce five |subtype| values here, corresponding to the
control sequences \.{\\openout}, \.{\\write}, \.{\\closeout}, and \.{\\special}.
The second word of I/O whatsits has a |write_stream| field
that identifies the write-stream number (0 to 15, or 16 for out-of-range and
positive, or 17 for out-of-range and negative).
In the case of \.{\\write} and \.{\\special}, there is also a field that
points to the reference count of a token list that should be sent. In the
case of \.{\\openout}, we need three words and three auxiliary subfields
to hold the string numbers for name, area, and extension.

@ Extensions might introduce new command codes; but it's best to use
|extension| with a modifier, whenever possible, so that |main_control|
stays the same.

@ The sixteen possible \.{\\write} streams are represented by the |write_file|
array. The |j|th file is open if and only if |write_open[j]=true|. The last
two streams are special; |write_open[16]| represents a stream number
greater than 15, while |write_open[17]| represents a negative stream number,
and both of these variables are always |false|.

@c
alpha_file write_file[last_file_selector+1];
halfword write_file_mode[last_file_selector+1];
halfword write_file_translation[last_file_selector+1];
boolean write_open[last_write_open+1];

scaled neg_wd;
scaled pos_wd;
scaled neg_ht;

@ The variable |write_loc| just introduced is used to provide an
appropriate error message in case of ``runaway'' write texts.

@c
halfword write_loc;             /* |eqtb| address of \.{\\write} */

/*
    hh: eventually i'll make \pdfextension a lua token parsed function;
    a complication is that sometimes token lists are delayed
*/

@ When an |extension| command occurs in |main_control|, in any mode,
the |do_extension| routine is called.

    Ad immediate:

    To write a token list, we must run it through \TeX's scanner, expanding

    if a delimited macro parameter isn't matched, and runaways would be
    extremely confusing since we are calling on \TeX's scanner in the middle
    of a \.{\\shipout} command. Therefore we will put a dummy control sequence as
    a ``stopper,'' right after the token list. This control sequence is
    artificially defined to be \.{\\outer}.

    The presence of `\.{\\immediate}' causes the |do_extension| procedure

@ This section is devoted to the {\sl Synchronize \TeX nology}
- or simply {\sl Sync\TeX} - used to synchronize between input and output.
This section explains how synchronization basics are implemented.
Before we enter into more technical details,
let us recall in a few words what is synchronization.

\TeX\ typesetting system clearly separates the input and the output material,
and synchronization will provide a new link between both that can help
text editors and viewers to work together.
More precisely, forwards synchronization is the ability,
given a location in the input source file,
to find what is the corresponding place in the output.
Backwards synchronization just performs the opposite:
given a location in the output,
retrieve the corresponding material in the input source file.

For better code management and maintainance, we adopt a naming convention.
Throughout this program, code related to the {\sl Synchronize \TeX nology} is tagged
with the ``{\sl synctex}'' key word. Any code extract where {\sl Sync\TeX} plays
its part, either explicitly or implicitly, (should) contain the string ``{\sl synctex}''.
This naming convention also holds for external files.
Moreover, all the code related to {\sl Sync\TeX} is gathered in this section,
except the definitions.

Enabling synchronization should be performed from the command line,
|synctexoption| is used for that purpose.
This global integer variable is declared here but it is not used here.
This is just a placeholder where the command line controller will put
the {\sl Sync\TeX} related options, and the {\sl Sync\TeX} controller will read them.

@c
int synctexoption;

@ A convenient primitive is provided:
\.{\\synctex=1} in the input source file enables synchronization whereas
\.{\\synctex=0} disables it.
Its memory address is |synctex_code|.
It is initialized by the {\sl Sync\TeX} controller to the command-line option if given.
The controller may filter some reserved bits.

In order to give the {\sl Sync\TeX} controller read and write access to
the contents of the \.{\\synctex} primitive, we declare |synctexoffset|,
such that |mem[synctexoffset]| and \.{\\synctex} correspond to
the same memory storage. |synctexoffset| is initialized to
the correct value when quite everything is initialized.

@c
int synctexoffset;              /* holds the true value of |synctex_code| */

@ Synchronization is achieved with the help of an auxiliary file named
`\.{{\sl jobname}.synctex}' ({\sl jobname} is the contents of the
\.{\\jobname} macro), where a {\sl Sync\TeX} controller implemented
in the external |synctex.c| file will store geometrical information.
This {\sl Sync\TeX} controller will take care of every technical details
concerning the {\sl Sync\TeX} file, we will only focus on the messages
the controller will receive from the \TeX\ program.

The most accurate synchronization information should allow to map
any character of the input source file to the corresponding location
in the output, if relevant.
Ideally, the synchronization information of the input material consists of
the file name, the line and column numbers of every character.
The synchronization information in the output is simply the page number and
either point coordinates, or box dimensions and position.
The problem is that the mapping between these informations is only known at
ship out time, which means that we must keep track of the input
synchronization information until the pages ship out.

As \TeX\ only knows about file names and line numbers,
but forgets the column numbers, we only consider a
restricted input synchronization information called {\sl Sync\TeX\ information}.
It consists of a unique file name identifier, the {\sl Sync\TeX\ file tag},
and the line number.

Keeping track of such information,
should be different whether characters or nodes are involved.
Actually, only certain nodes are involved in {\sl Sync\TeX},
we call them {\sl synchronized nodes}.
Synchronized nodes store the {\sl Sync\TeX} information in their last two words:
the first one contains a {\sl Sync\TeX\ file tag} uniquely identifying
the input file, and the second one contains the current line number,
as returned by the \.{\\inputlineno} primitive.
The |synctex_field_size| macro contains the necessary size to store
the {\sl Sync\TeX} information in a node.

When declaring the size of a new node, it is recommanded to use the following
convention: if the node is synchronized, use a definition similar to
|my_synchronized_node_size|={\sl xxx}+|synctex_field_size|.
Moreover, one should expect that the {\sl Sync\TeX} information is always stored
in the last two words of a synchronized node.

By default, every node with a sufficiently big size is initialized
at creation time in the |get_node| routine with the current
{\sl Sync\TeX} information, whether or not the node is synchronized.
One purpose is to set this information very early in order to minimize code
dependencies, including forthcoming extensions.
Another purpose is to avoid the assumption that every node type has a dedicated getter,
where initialization should take place. Actually, it appears that some nodes are created
using directly the |get_node| routine and not the dedicated constructor.
And finally, initializing the node at only one place is less error prone.

Instead of storing the input file name, it is better to store just an identifier.
Each time \TeX\ opens a new file, it notifies the {\sl Sync\TeX} controller with
a |synctex_start_input| message.
This controller will create a new {\sl Sync\TeX} file tag and
will update the current input state record accordingly.
If the input comes from the terminal or a pseudo file, the |synctex_tag| is set to 0.
It results in automatically disabling synchronization for material
input from the terminal or pseudo files.

Synchronized nodes are boxes, math, kern and glue nodes.
Other nodes should be synchronized too, in particular math noads.
\TeX\ assumes that math, kern and glue nodes have the same size,
this is why both are synchronized.
{\sl In fine}, only horizontal lists are really used in {\sl Sync\TeX},
but all box nodes are considered the same with respect to synchronization,
because a box node type is allowed to change at execution time.

{\sl Nota Bene:}
The {\sl Sync\TeX} code is very close to the memory model.
It is not connected to any other part of the code,
except for memory management. It is possible to neutralize the {\sl Sync\TeX} code
rather simply. The first step is to define a null |synctex_field_size|.
The second step is to comment out the code in ``Initialize bigger nodes...'' and every
``Copy ... {\sl Sync\TeX} information''.
The last step will be to comment out the |synctex_tag_field| related code in the
definition of |synctex_tag| and the various ``Prepare ... {\sl Sync\TeX} information''.
Then all the remaining code should be just harmless.
The resulting program would behave exactly the same as if absolutely no {\sl Sync\TeX}
related code was there, including memory management.
Of course, all this assumes that {\sl Sync\TeX} is turned off from the command line.
