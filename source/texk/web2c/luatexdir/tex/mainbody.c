This is LuaTeX, a continuation of $\pdfTeX$ and $\Aleph$.  LuaTeX is a
document compiler intended to simplify high-quality typesetting for
many of the world's languages.  It is an extension of D. E. Knuth's
\TeX, which was designed essentially for the typesetting of languages
using the Latin alphabet.

The $\Aleph$ subsystem loosens many of the restrictions imposed by~\TeX:
register numbers are no longer limited to 8~bits;  fonts may have more
than 256~characters;  more than 256~fonts may be used;  etc.

The \PASCAL\ program that follows is the definition of \TeX82, a standard
@:PASCAL}{\PASCAL@>
@!@:TeX82}{\TeX82@>
version of \TeX\ that is designed to be highly portable so that
identical output will be obtainable on a great variety of computers.

The main purpose of the following program is to explain the algorithms of \TeX\
as clearly as possible. As a result, the program will not necessarily be very
efficient when a particular \PASCAL\ compiler has translated it into a
particular machine language. However, the program has been written so that it
can be tuned to run efficiently in a wide variety of operating environments
by making comparatively few changes. Such flexibility is possible because
the documentation that follows is written in the \.{WEB} language, which is
at a higher level than \PASCAL; the preprocessing step that converts \.{WEB}
to \PASCAL\ is able to introduce most of the necessary refinements.
Semi-automatic translation to other languages is also feasible, because the
program below does not make extensive use of features that are peculiar to
\PASCAL.

A large piece of software like \TeX\ has inherent complexity that cannot
be reduced below a certain level of difficulty, although each individual
part is fairly simple by itself. The \.{WEB} language is intended to make
the algorithms as readable as possible, by reflecting the way the
individual program pieces fit together and by providing the
cross-references that connect different parts. Detailed comments about
what is going on, and about why things were done in certain ways, have
been liberally sprinkled throughout the program.  These comments explain
features of the implementation, but they rarely attempt to explain the
\TeX\ language itself, since the reader is supposed to be familiar with
{\sl The \TeX book}.
@.WEB@>
@:TeXbook}{\sl The \TeX book@>

@ The present implementation has a long ancestry, beginning in the summer
of~1977, when Michael~F. Plass and Frank~M. Liang designed and coded
a prototype
@^Plass, Michael Frederick@>
@^Liang, Franklin Mark@>
@^Knuth, Donald Ervin@>
based on some specifications that the author had made in May of that year.
This original proto\TeX\ included macro definitions and elementary
manipulations on boxes and glue, but it did not have line-breaking,
page-breaking, mathematical formulas, alignment routines, error recovery,
or the present semantic nest; furthermore,
it used character lists instead of token lists, so that a control sequence
like \.{\\halign} was represented by a list of seven characters. A
complete version of \TeX\ was designed and coded by the author in late
1977 and early 1978; that program, like its prototype, was written in the
{\mc SAIL} language, for which an excellent debugging system was
available. Preliminary plans to convert the {\mc SAIL} code into a form
somewhat like the present ``web'' were developed by Luis Trabb~Pardo and
@^Trabb Pardo, Luis Isidoro@>
the author at the beginning of 1979, and a complete implementation was
created by Ignacio~A. Zabala in 1979 and 1980. The \TeX82 program, which
@^Zabala Salelles, Ignacio Andr\'es@>
was written by the author during the latter part of 1981 and the early
part of 1982, also incorporates ideas from the 1979 implementation of
@^Guibas, Leonidas Ioannis@>
@^Sedgewick, Robert@>
@^Wyatt, Douglas Kirk@>
\TeX\ in {\mc MESA} that was written by Leonidas Guibas, Robert Sedgewick,
and Douglas Wyatt at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.  Several hundred
refinements were introduced into \TeX82 based on the experiences gained with
the original implementations, so that essentially every part of the system
has been substantially improved. After the appearance of ``Version 0'' in
September 1982, this program benefited greatly from the comments of
many other people, notably David~R. Fuchs and Howard~W. Trickey.
A final revision in September 1989 extended the input character set to
eight-bit codes and introduced the ability to hyphenate words from
different languages, based on some ideas of Michael~J. Ferguson.
@^Fuchs, David Raymond@>
@^Trickey, Howard Wellington@>
@^Ferguson, Michael John@>

No doubt there still is plenty of room for improvement, but the author
is firmly committed to keeping \TeX82 ``frozen'' from now on; stability
and reliability are to be its main virtues.

On the other hand, the \.{WEB} description can be extended without changing
the core of \TeX82 itself, and the program has been designed so that such
extensions are not extremely difficult to make.
The |banner| string defined here should be changed whenever \TeX\
undergoes any modifications, so that it will be clear which version of
\TeX\ might be the guilty party when a problem arises.
@^extensions to \TeX@>
@^system dependencies@>

This program contains code for various features extending \TeX,
therefore this program is called `\eTeX' and not
`\TeX'; the official name `\TeX' by itself is reserved
for software systems that are fully compatible with each other.
A special test suite called the ``\.{TRIP} test'' is available for
helping to determine whether a particular implementation deserves to be
known as `\TeX' [cf.~Stanford Computer Science report CS1027,
November 1984].

A similar test suite called the ``\.{e-TRIP} test'' is available for
helping to determine whether a particular implementation deserves to be
known as `\eTeX'.

/*
@ Different \PASCAL s have slightly different conventions, and the present
@!@:PASCAL H}{\ph@>
program expresses \TeX\ in terms of the \PASCAL\ that was
available to the author in 1982. Constructions that apply to
this particular compiler, which we shall call \ph, should help the
reader see how to make an appropriate interface for other systems
if necessary. (\ph\ is Charles Hedrick's modification of a compiler
@^Hedrick, Charles Locke@>
for the DECsystem-10 that was originally developed at the University of
Hamburg; cf.\ {\sl SOFTWARE---Practice \AM\ Experience \bf6} (1976),
29--42. The \TeX\ program below is intended to be adaptable, without
extensive changes, to most other versions of \PASCAL, so it does not fully
use the admirable features of \ph. Indeed, a conscious effort has been
made here to avoid using several idiosyncratic features of standard
\PASCAL\ itself, so that most of the code can be translated mechanically
into other high-level languages. For example, the `\&{with}' and `\\{new}'
features are not used, nor are pointer types, set types, or enumerated
scalar types; there are no `\&{var}' parameters, except in the case of files
--- \eTeX, however, does use `\&{var}' parameters for the |reverse| function;
there are no tag fields on variant records; there are no assignments
|real:=integer|; no procedures are declared local to other procedures.)

The portions of this program that involve system-dependent code, where
changes might be necessary because of differences between \PASCAL\ compilers
and/or differences between
operating systems, can be identified by looking at the sections whose
numbers are listed under `system dependencies' in the index. Furthermore,
the index entries for `dirty \PASCAL' list all places where the restrictions
of \PASCAL\ have not been followed perfectly, for one reason or another.
@!@^system dependencies@>
@!@^dirty \PASCAL@>

Incidentally, \PASCAL's standard |round| function can be problematical,
because it disagrees with the IEEE floating-point standard.
Many implementors have
therefore chosen to substitute their own home-grown rounding procedure.

@ The program begins with a normal \PASCAL\ program heading, whose
components will be filled in later, using the conventions of \.{WEB}.
@.WEB@>
For example, the portion of the program called `\X\glob:Global
variables\X' below will be replaced by a sequence of variable declarations
that starts in $\section\glob$ of this documentation. In this way, we are able
to define each individual global variable when we are prepared to
understand what it means; we do not have to define all of the globals at
once.  Cross references in $\section\glob$, where it says ``See also
sections \gglob, \dots,'' also make it possible to look at the set of
all global variables, if desired.  Similar remarks apply to the other
portions of the program heading.

*/

/*
The overall \TeX\ program begins with the heading just shown, after which
comes a bunch of procedure declarations and function declarations.
Finally we will get to the main program, which begins with the
comment `|start_here|'. If you want to skip down to the
main program now, you can look up `|start_here|' in the index.
But the author suggests that the best way to understand this program
is to follow pretty much the order of \TeX's components as they appear in the
\.{WEB} description you are now reading, since the present ordering is
intended to combine the advantages of the ``bottom up'' and ``top down''
approaches to the problem of understanding a somewhat complicated system.

@ Three labels must be declared in the main program, so we give them
symbolic names.

@ Some of the code below is intended to be used only when diagnosing the
strange behavior that sometimes occurs when \TeX\ is being installed or
when system wizards are fooling around with \TeX\ without quite knowing
what they are doing. Such code will not normally be compiled; it is
delimited by the codewords `$|debug|\ldots|gubed|$', with apologies
to people who wish to preserve the purity of English.

Similarly, there is some conditional code delimited by
`$|stat|\ldots|tats|$' that is intended for use when statistics are to be
kept about \TeX's memory usage.  The |stat| $\ldots$ |tats| code also
implements diagnostic information for \.{\\tracingparagraphs} and
\.{\\tracingpages}.
@^debugging@>

*/

/*
If the first character of a \PASCAL\ comment is a dollar sign,
\ph\ treats the comment as a list of ``compiler directives'' that will
affect the translation of this program into machine language.  The
directives shown below specify full checking and inclusion of the \PASCAL\
debugger when \TeX\ is being debugged, but they cause range checking and other
redundant code to be eliminated when the production system is being generated.
Arithmetic overflow will be detected in all cases.
@:PASCAL H}{\ph@>
@^system dependencies@>
@^overflow in arithmetic@>

@ This \TeX\ implementation conforms to the rules of the {\sl Pascal User
@:PASCAL}{\PASCAL@>
@^system dependencies@>
Manual} published by Jensen and Wirth in 1975, except where system-dependent
@^Wirth, Niklaus@>
@^Jensen, Kathleen@>
code is necessary to make a useful system program, and except in another
respect where such conformity would unnecessarily obscure the meaning
and clutter up the code: We assume that |case| statements may include a
default case that applies if no matching label is found. Thus, we shall use
constructions like
$$\vbox{\halign{\ignorespaces#\hfil\cr
|case x of|\cr
1: $\langle\,$code for $x=1\,\rangle$;\cr
3: $\langle\,$code for $x=3\,\rangle$;\cr
|othercases| $\langle\,$code for |x<>1| and |x<>3|$\,\rangle$\cr
|endcases|\cr}}$$
since most \PASCAL\ compilers have plugged this hole in the language by
incorporating some sort of default mechanism. For example, the \ph\
compiler allows `|others|:' as a default label, and other \PASCAL s allow
syntaxes like `\&{else}' or `\&{otherwise}' or `\\{otherwise}:', etc. The
definitions of |othercases| and |endcases| should be changed to agree with
local conventions.  Note that no semicolon appears before |endcases| in
this program, so the definition of |endcases| should include a semicolon
if the compiler wants one. (Of course, if no default mechanism is
available, the |case| statements of \TeX\ will have to be laboriously
extended by listing all remaining cases. People who are stuck with such
\PASCAL s have, in fact, done this, successfully but not happily!)
@:PASCAL H}{\ph@>

/*
In case somebody has inadvertently made bad settings of the ``constants,''
\TeX\ checks them using a global variable called |bad|.

defined.

Characters of text that have been converted to \TeX's internal form
are said to be of type |ASCII_code|, which is a subrange of the integers.
*/

/*
The original \PASCAL\ compiler was designed in the late 60s, when six-bit
character sets were common, so it did not make provision for lowercase
letters. Nowadays, of course, we need to deal with both capital and small
letters in a convenient way, especially in a program for typesetting;
so the present specification of \TeX\ has been written under the assumption
that the \PASCAL\ compiler and run-time system permit the use of text files
with more than 64 distinguishable characters. More precisely, we assume that
the character set contains at least the letters and symbols associated
with ASCII codes @'40 through @'176; all of these characters are now
available on most computer terminals.

Since we are dealing with more characters than were present in the first
\PASCAL\ compilers, we have to decide what to call the associated data
type. Some \PASCAL s use the original name |char| for the
characters in text files, even though there now are more than 64 such
characters, while other \PASCAL s consider |char| to be a 64-element
subrange of a larger data type that has some other name.

In order to accommodate this difference, we shall use the name |text_char|
to stand for the data type of the characters that are converted to and
from |ASCII_code| when they are input and output. We shall also assume
that |text_char| consists of the elements |chr(first_text_char)| through
|chr(last_text_char)|, inclusive. The following definitions should be
adjusted if necessary.
@^system dependencies@>

We are assuming that our runtime system is able to read and write UTF-8. 

Some of the ASCII codes without visible characters have been given symbolic
names in this program because they are used with a special meaning.

/*
In order to make efficient use of storage space, \TeX\ bases its major data
structures on a |memory_word|, which contains either a (signed) integer,
possibly scaled, or a (signed) |glue_ratio|, or a small number of
fields that are one half or one quarter of the size used for storing
integers.

If |x| is a variable of type |memory_word|, it contains up to four
fields that can be referred to as follows:
$$\vbox{\halign{\hfil#&#\hfil&#\hfil\cr
|x|&.|int|&(an |integer|)\cr
|x|&.|sc|\qquad&(a |scaled| integer)\cr
|x|&.|gr|&(a |glue_ratio|)\cr
|x.hh.lh|, |x.hh|&.|rh|&(two halfword fields)\cr
|x.hh.b0|, |x.hh.b1|, |x.hh|&.|rh|&(two quarterword fields, one halfword
  field)\cr
|x.qqqq.b0|, |x.qqqq.b1|, |x.qqqq|&.|b2|, |x.qqqq.b3|\hskip-100pt
  &\qquad\qquad\qquad(four quarterword fields)\cr}}$$
This is somewhat cumbersome to write, and not very readable either, but
macros will be used to make the notation shorter and more transparent.
The \PASCAL\ code below gives a formal definition of |memory_word| and
its subsidiary types, using packed variant records. \TeX\ makes no
assumptions about the relative positions of the fields within a word.

We are assuming 32-bit integers, a halfword must contain at least
32 bits, and a quarterword must contain at least 16 bits.
@^system dependencies@>

N.B.: Valuable memory space will be dreadfully wasted unless \TeX\ is compiled
by a \PASCAL\ that packs all of the |memory_word| variants into
the space of a single integer. This means, for example, that |glue_ratio|
words should be |short_real| instead of |real| on some computers. Some
\PASCAL\ compilers will pack an integer whose subrange is `|0..255|' into
an eight-bit field, but others insist on allocating space for an additional
sign bit; on such systems you can get 256 values into a quarterword only
if the subrange is `|-128..127|'.

The present implementation tries to accommodate as many variations as possible,
so it makes few assumptions. If integers having the subrange
`|min_quarterword..max_quarterword|' can be packed into a quarterword,
and if integers having the subrange `|min_halfword..max_halfword|'
can be packed into a halfword, everything should work satisfactorily.

It is usually most efficient to have |min_quarterword=min_halfword=0|,
so one should try to achieve this unless it causes a severe problem.
The values defined here are recommended for most 32-bit computers.

We cannot use the full range of 32 bits in a halfword, because we have

/*
Control sequences are stored and retrieved by means of a fairly standard hash
table algorithm called the method of ``coalescing lists'' (cf.\ Algorithm 6.4C
in {\sl The Art of Computer Programming\/}). Once a control sequence enters the
table, it is never removed, because there are complicated situations
involving \.{\\gdef} where the removal of a control sequence at the end of
a group would be a mistake preventable only by the introduction of a
complicated reference-count mechanism.

The actual sequence of letters forming a control sequence identifier is
stored in the |str_pool| array together with all the other strings. An
auxiliary array |hash| consists of items with two halfword fields per
word. The first of these, called |next(p)|, points to the next identifier
belonging to the same coalesced list as the identifier corresponding to~|p|;
and the other, called |text(p)|, points to the |str_start| entry for
|p|'s identifier. If position~|p| of the hash table is empty, we have
|text(p)=0|; if position |p| is either empty or the end of a coalesced
hash list, we have |next(p)=0|. An auxiliary pointer variable called
|hash_used| is maintained in such a way that all locations |p>=hash_used|
are nonempty. The global variable |cs_count| tells how many multiletter
control sequences have been defined, if statistics are being kept.

A global boolean variable called |no_new_control_sequence| is set to
|true| during the time that new hash table entries are forbidden.

/*
Let's pause a moment now and try to look at the Big Picture.
The \TeX\ program consists of three main parts: syntactic routines,
semantic routines, and output routines. The chief purpose of the
syntactic routines is to deliver the user's input to the semantic routines,
one token at a time. The semantic routines act as an interpreter
responding to these tokens, which may be regarded as commands. And the
output routines are periodically called on to convert box-and-glue
lists into a compact set of instructions that will be sent
to a typesetter. We have discussed the basic data structures and utility
routines of \TeX, so we are good and ready to plunge into the real activity by
considering the syntactic routines.

Our current goal is to come to grips with the |get_next| procedure,
which is the keystone of \TeX's input mechanism. Each call of |get_next|
sets the value of three variables |cur_cmd|, |cur_chr|, and |cur_cs|,
representing the next input token.
$$\vbox{\halign{#\hfil\cr
  \hbox{|cur_cmd| denotes a command code from the long list of codes
   given above;}\cr
  \hbox{|cur_chr| denotes a character code or other modifier of the command
   code;}\cr
  \hbox{|cur_cs| is the |eqtb| location of the current control sequence,}\cr
  \hbox{\qquad if the current token was a control sequence,
   otherwise it's zero.}\cr}}$$
Underlying this external behavior of |get_next| is all the machinery
necessary to convert from character files to tokens. At a given time we
may be only partially finished with the reading of several files (for
which \.{\\input} was specified), and partially finished with the expansion
of some user-defined macros and/or some macro parameters, and partially
finished with the generation of some text in a template for \.{\\halign},
and so on. When reading a character file, special characters must be
classified as math delimiters, etc.; comments and extra blank spaces must
be removed, paragraphs must be recognized, and control sequences must be
found in the hash table. Furthermore there are occasions in which the
scanning routines have looked ahead for a word like `\.{plus}' but only
part of that word was found, hence a few characters must be put back
into the input and scanned again.

To handle these situations, which might all be present simultaneously,
\TeX\ uses various stacks that hold information about the incomplete
activities, and there is a finite state control for each level of the
input mechanism. These stacks record the current state of an implicitly
recursive process, but the |get_next| procedure is not recursive.
Therefore it will not be difficult to translate these algorithms into
low-level languages that do not support recursion.

This is it: the part of \TeX\ that executes all those procedures we have
written.

@ We have noted that there are two versions of \TeX82. One, called \.{INITEX},
@.INITEX@>
has to be run first; it initializes everything from scratch, without
reading a format file, and it has the capability of dumping a format file.
The other one is called `\.{VIRTEX}'; it is a ``virgin'' program that needs
@.VIRTEX@>
to input a format file in order to get started. \.{VIRTEX} typically has
more memory capacity than \.{INITEX}, because it does not need the space
consumed by the auxiliary hyphenation tables and the numerous calls on
|primitive|, etc.

The \.{VIRTEX} program cannot read a format file instantaneously, of course;
the best implementations therefore allow for production versions of \TeX\ that
not only avoid the loading routine for \PASCAL\ object code, they also have
a format file pre-loaded. This is impossible to do if we stick to standard
\PASCAL; but there is a simple way to fool many systems into avoiding the
initialization, as follows:\quad(1)~We declare a global integer variable
called |ready_already|. The probability is negligible that this
variable holds any particular value like 314159 when \.{VIRTEX} is first
loaded.\quad(2)~After we have read in a format file and initialized
everything, we set |ready_already:=314159|.\quad(3)~Soon \.{VIRTEX}
will print `\.*', waiting for more input; and at this point we
interrupt the program and save its core image in some form that the
operating system can reload speedily.\quad(4)~When that core image is
activated, the program starts again at the beginning; but now
|ready_already=314159| and all the other global variables have
their initial values too. The former chastity has vanished!

In other words, if we allow ourselves to test the condition
|ready_already=314159|, before |ready_already| has been
assigned a value, we can avoid the lengthy initialization. Dirty tricks
rarely pay off so handsomely.

/*
@ Now this is really it: \TeX\ starts and ends here.

The initial test involving |ready_already| should be deleted if the
\PASCAL\ runtime system is smart enough to detect such a ``mistake.''

Once \TeX\ is working, you should be able to diagnose most errors with
the \.{\\show} commands and other diagnostic features. But for the initial
stages of debugging, and for the revelation of really deep mysteries, you
can compile \TeX\ with a few more aids, including the \PASCAL\ runtime
checks and its debugger. An additional routine called |debug_help|
will also come into play when you type `\.D' after an error message;
|debug_help| also occurs just before a fatal error causes \TeX\ to succumb.
@^debugging@>
@^system dependencies@>

The interface to |debug_help| is primitive, but it is good enough when used
with a \PASCAL\ debugger that allows you to set breakpoints and to read
variables and change their values. After getting the prompt `\.{debug \#}', you
type either a negative number (this exits |debug_help|), or zero (this
goes to a location where you can set a breakpoint, thereby entering into
dialog with the \PASCAL\ debugger), or a positive number |m| followed by
an argument |n|. The meaning of |m| and |n| will be clear from the
program below. (If |m=13|, there is an additional argument, |l|.)

This index also lists error messages and other aspects of the program
