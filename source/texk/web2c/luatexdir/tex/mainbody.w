pdfTeX is copyright (C) 1996-2006 Han The Thanh, <thanh@@pdftex.org>.

e-TeX is copyright (C) 1994,98 by Peter Breitenlohner.

This is LuaTeX, a continuation of $\pdfTeX$ and $\Aleph$.  LuaTeX is a
document compiler intended to simplify high-quality typesetting for
many of the world's languages.  It is an extension of D. E. Knuth's
\TeX, which was designed essentially for the typesetting of languages
using the Latin alphabet.

The $\Aleph$ subsystem loosens many of the restrictions imposed by~\TeX:
register numbers are no longer limited to 8~bits;  fonts may have more
than 256~characters;  more than 256~fonts may be used;  etc.

% This program is directly derived from Donald E. Knuth's TeX;
% the change history which follows and the reward offered for finders of
% bugs refer specifically to TeX; they should not be taken as referring
% to LuaTeX, pdfTeX, nor e-TeX, although the change history is relevant in that it
% demonstrates the evolutionary path followed.  This program is not TeX;
% that name is reserved strictly for the program which is the creation
% and sole responsibility of Professor Knuth.

A large piece of software like \TeX\ has inherent complexity that cannot
be reduced below a certain level of difficulty, although each individual
part is fairly simple by itself. The \.{WEB} language is intended to make
the algorithms as readable as possible, by reflecting the way the
individual program pieces fit together and by providing the
cross-references that connect different parts. Detailed comments about
what is going on, and about why things were done in certain ways, have
been liberally sprinkled throughout the program.  These comments explain
features of the implementation, but they rarely attempt to explain the
\TeX\ language itself, since the reader is supposed to be familiar with
{\sl The \TeX book}.
@.WEB@>
@:TeXbook}{\sl The \TeX book@>

The present implementation has a long ancestry, beginning in the summer
of~1977, when Michael~F. Plass and Frank~M. Liang designed and coded
a prototype
@^Plass, Michael Frederick@>
@^Liang, Franklin Mark@>
@^Knuth, Donald Ervin@>
based on some specifications that the author had made in May of that year.
This original proto\TeX\ included macro definitions and elementary
manipulations on boxes and glue, but it did not have line-breaking,
page-breaking, mathematical formulas, alignment routines, error recovery,
or the present semantic nest; furthermore,
it used character lists instead of token lists, so that a control sequence
like \.{\\halign} was represented by a list of seven characters. A
complete version of \TeX\ was designed and coded by the author in late
1977 and early 1978; that program, like its prototype, was written in the
{\mc SAIL} language, for which an excellent debugging system was
available. Preliminary plans to convert the {\mc SAIL} code into a form
somewhat like the present ``web'' were developed by Luis Trabb~Pardo and
@^Trabb Pardo, Luis Isidoro@>
the author at the beginning of 1979, and a complete implementation was
created by Ignacio~A. Zabala in 1979 and 1980. The \TeX82 program, which
@^Zabala Salelles, Ignacio Andr\'es@>
was written by the author during the latter part of 1981 and the early
part of 1982, also incorporates ideas from the 1979 implementation of
@^Guibas, Leonidas Ioannis@>
@^Sedgewick, Robert@>
@^Wyatt, Douglas Kirk@>
\TeX\ in {\mc MESA} that was written by Leonidas Guibas, Robert Sedgewick,
and Douglas Wyatt at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.  Several hundred
refinements were introduced into \TeX82 based on the experiences gained with
the original implementations, so that essentially every part of the system
has been substantially improved. After the appearance of ``Version 0'' in
September 1982, this program benefited greatly from the comments of
many other people, notably David~R. Fuchs and Howard~W. Trickey.
A final revision in September 1989 extended the input character set to
eight-bit codes and introduced the ability to hyphenate words from
different languages, based on some ideas of Michael~J. Ferguson.
@^Fuchs, David Raymond@>
@^Trickey, Howard Wellington@>
@^Ferguson, Michael John@>

No doubt there still is plenty of room for improvement, but the author
is firmly committed to keeping \TeX82 ``frozen'' from now on; stability
and reliability are to be its main virtues.

On the other hand, the \.{WEB} description can be extended without changing
the core of \TeX82 itself, and the program has been designed so that such
extensions are not extremely difficult to make.
The |banner| string defined here should be changed whenever \TeX\
undergoes any modifications, so that it will be clear which version of
\TeX\ might be the guilty party when a problem arises.
@^extensions to \TeX@>
@^system dependencies@>

This program contains code for various features extending \TeX,
therefore this program is called `\eTeX' and not
`\TeX'; the official name `\TeX' by itself is reserved
for software systems that are fully compatible with each other.
A special test suite called the ``\.{TRIP} test'' is available for
helping to determine whether a particular implementation deserves to be
known as `\TeX' [cf.~Stanford Computer Science report CS1027,
November 1984].

A similar test suite called the ``\.{e-TRIP} test'' is available for
helping to determine whether a particular implementation deserves to be
known as `\eTeX'.

@ This is it: the part of \TeX\ that executes all those procedures we have
written.

We have noted that there are two versions of \TeX82. One, called \.{INITEX},

has to be run first; it initializes everything from scratch, without
reading a format file, and it has the capability of dumping a format file.

to input a format file in order to get started.

@ Here we do whatever is needed to complete \TeX's job gracefully on the
local operating system. The code here might come into play after a fatal
error; it must therefore consist entirely of ``safe'' operations that
cannot produce error messages. For example, it would be a mistake to call
|str_room| or |make_string| at this time, because a call on |overflow|
might lead to an infinite loop.

Actually there's one way to get error messages, via |prepare_mag|;
but that can't cause infinite recursion.

@ Once \TeX\ is working, you should be able to diagnose most errors with
the \.{\\show} commands and other diagnostic features.
An additional routine called |debug_help|
will come into play when you type `\.D' after an error message;
|debug_help| also occurs just before a fatal error causes \TeX\ to succumb.
@^debugging@>
@^system dependencies@>

The interface to |debug_help| is primitive, but it is good enough when used
with a debugger that allows you to set breakpoints and to read
variables and change their values. After getting the prompt `\.{debug \#}', you
type either a negative number (this exits |debug_help|), or zero (this
goes to a location where you can set a breakpoint, thereby entering into
dialog with the debugger), or a positive number |m| followed by
an argument |n|. The meaning of |m| and |n| will be clear from the
program below. (If |m=13|, there is an additional argument, |l|.)
