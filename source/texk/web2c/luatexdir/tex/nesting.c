/*
\TeX\ is typically in the midst of building many lists at once. For example,
when a math formula is being processed, \TeX\ is in math mode and
working on an mlist; this formula has temporarily interrupted \TeX\ from
being in horizontal mode and building the hlist of a paragraph; and this
paragraph has temporarily interrupted \TeX\ from being in vertical mode
and building the vlist for the next page of a document. Similarly, when a
\.{\\vbox} occurs inside of an \.{\\hbox}, \TeX\ is temporarily
interrupted from working in restricted horizontal mode, and it enters
internal vertical mode.  The ``semantic nest'' is a stack that
keeps track of what lists and modes are currently suspended.

At each level of processing we are in one of six modes:

\yskip\hang|vmode| stands for vertical mode (the page builder);

\hang|hmode| stands for horizontal mode (the paragraph builder);

\hang|mmode| stands for displayed formula mode;

\hang|-vmode| stands for internal vertical mode (e.g., in a \.{\\vbox});

\hang|-hmode| stands for restricted horizontal mode (e.g., in an \.{\\hbox});

\hang|-mmode| stands for math formula mode (not displayed).

\yskip\noindent The mode is temporarily set to zero while processing \.{\\write}
texts in the |ship_out| routine.

Numeric values are assigned to |vmode|, |hmode|, and |mmode| so that
\TeX's ``big semantic switch'' can select the appropriate thing to
do by computing the value |abs(mode)+cur_cmd|, where |mode| is the current
mode and |cur_cmd| is the current command code.

The state of affairs at any semantic level can be represented by
five values:

\yskip\hang|mode| is the number representing the semantic mode, as
just explained.

\yskip\hang|head| is a |pointer| to a list head for the list being built;
|link(head)| therefore points to the first element of the list, or
to |null| if the list is empty.

\yskip\hang|tail| is a |pointer| to the final node of the list being
built; thus, |tail=head| if and only if the list is empty.

\yskip\hang|prev_graf| is the number of lines of the current paragraph that
have already been put into the present vertical list.

\yskip\hang|aux| is an auxiliary |memory_word| that gives further information
that is needed to characterize the situation.

\yskip\noindent
In vertical mode, |aux| is also known as |prev_depth|; it is the scaled
value representing the depth of the previous box, for use in baseline
calculations, or it is |<=-1000|pt if the next box on the vertical list is to
be exempt from baseline calculations.  In horizontal mode, |aux| is also
known as |space_factor|; it holds the current space factor used in
spacing calculations. In math mode, |aux| is also known as |incompleat_noad|;
if not |null|, it points to a record that represents the numerator of a
generalized fraction for which the denominator is currently being formed
in the current list.

There is also a sixth quantity, |mode_line|, which correlates
the semantic nest with the user's input; |mode_line| contains the source
line number at which the current level of nesting was entered. The negative
of this line number is the |mode_line| at the level of the
user's output routine.

A seventh quantity, |eTeX_aux|, is used by the extended features \eTeX.
In math mode it is known as |delim_ptr| and points to the most
recent |fence_noad|  of a |math_left_group|.

In horizontal mode, the |prev_graf| field is used for initial language data.

The semantic nest is an array called |nest| that holds the |mode|, |head|,
|tail|, |prev_graf|, |aux|, and |mode_line| values for all semantic levels
below the currently active one. Information about the currently active
level is kept in the global quantities |mode|, |head|, |tail|, |prev_graf|,
|aux|, and |mode_line|, which live in a \PASCAL\ record that is ready to
be pushed onto |nest| if necessary.

The math field is used by various bits and pieces in |math.c|

/*
@ This implementation of
\TeX\ uses two different conventions for representing sequential stacks.
@^stack conventions@>@^conventions for representing stacks@>

\yskip\hangg 1) If there is frequent access to the top entry, and if the
stack is essentially never empty, then the top entry is kept in a global
variable (even better would be a machine register), and the other entries
appear in the array $\\{stack}[0\to(\\{ptr}-1)]$. The
semantic stack is handled this way.

\yskip\hangg 2) If there is infrequent top access, the entire stack contents
are in the array $\\{stack}[0\to(\\{ptr}-1)]$. For example, the |save_stack|
is treated this way, as we have seen.

We will see later that the vertical list at the bottom semantic level is split
into two parts; the ``current page'' runs from |page_head| to |page_tail|,
and the ``contribution list'' runs from |contrib_head| to |tail| of
semantic level zero. The idea is that contributions are first formed in
vertical mode, then ``contributed'' to the current page (during which time
the page-breaking decisions are made). For now, we don't need to know
any more details about the page-building process.
