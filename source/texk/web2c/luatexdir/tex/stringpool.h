  Several of the elementary string operations are performed using

  operations are done quite frequently and we want to avoid the
  overhead of procedure calls. For example, here is
  a simple macro that computes the length of a string.

   The |append_char| macro, defined here, does not check to see if the
   value of |pool_ptr| has gotten too high; this test is supposed to be
   made before |append_char| is used. There is also a |flush_char|
   macro, which erases the last character appended.

   To test if there is room to append |l| more characters to |str_pool|,
   we shall write |str_room(l)|, which aborts \TeX\ and gives an
   apologetic error message if there isn't enough room.
