This info used to be in a howto/ subdirectory; it was written a long
time ago, by Sebastian and/or Thomas Esser, I think.

==> freetype <==
The following files have been added:
  freeetype.ac withenable.ac

Modifications:
  configure.in:
    disable AM_DISABLE_STATIC
    add AM_DISABLE_SHARED

==> freetype2 <==
The freetype2 directory contains Freetype 2.3.7 sources from:

  http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/freetype-2.3.7.tar.bz2

The following files have been added:

  freetype2.ac
  withenable.ac

Modifications:

  freetype2/builds/unix/configure
    - edited to ignore the --srcdir argument, as this doesn't work properly
      in the tex-live build


==> icu-xetex <==
The icu-xetex directory contains a *MODIFIED* copy of ICU release 3.8.1,
used in building xetex.

The following files have been added:

  icu-xetex.ac
  withenable.ac

See libs/icu-xetex/README for more information.

==> libpng <==
Downloading:
  http://www.libpng.org/
  http://libpng.sourceforge.net/

libpng is the original distribution, but with added
  Makefile.in libpng.ac withenable.ac

The directories
  contrib projects scripts
are not needed for teTeX and can be removed.

libpng is configured by libs/configure, so the (original)
libs/libpng/configure is not used by teTeX.

==> libtiff <==
Downloading:
  http://www.libtiff.org/
  http://freshmeat.net/projects/libtiff/

Which files are in libtiff:
  from the original distribution:
    COPYRIGHT RELEASE-DATE VERSION libtiff/* dist/tiff.alpha

  added for teTeX:
    acconfig.h aclocal.m4 configure.in libtiff.ac withenable.ac port.h
    Makefile.in (replacing the original file)
  added for fpTeX:
    win32 win32.mak

Generated files:
  the commands
    autoheader -m ../../texk/etc/autoconf
    autoconf -m ../../texk/etc/autoconf
  have generated
    c-auto.in configure

  by make depend:
    depend.mak

==> ncurses <==
Downloading:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/
  ftp://dickey.his.com/ncurses/

The ncurses directory contains the original distribution except:
  Ada95 c++ doc form menu misc panel progs tack test 

The following files have been added:
  ncurses.ac withenable.ac

Modifications:
  Makefile.in:
    remove install from the list in the end. Create an empty install::
    target somewhere earlier in the file.

    protect "test ... || ..." in Makefile.in with - 

  aclocal.m4, remove the following lines (thus disabling misc test
  c++ subdirs):
    SRC_SUBDIRS="$SRC_SUBDIRS test"
    test -z "$MAKE_TERMINFO" && SRC_SUBDIRS="$SRC_SUBDIRS misc"
    test "$cf_with_cxx_binding" != no && SRC_SUBDIRS="$SRC_SUBDIRS c++"

  include/Makefile.in
    add symlink to AUTO_SRC variable
    add a rule
      symlink:
        @test -d ncurses || ln -s . ncurses
    add the line
      -rm -f ncurses
    to the clean:: target

  configure.in:
     remove that ldconfig stuff
     remove that cxx stuff
     remove that ada stuff
     cf_with_progs=no (instead of yes)
     remove the line
       modules_to_build="$modules_to_build panel menu form"
     with_debug=no (instead of yes)
     move one line below (after CF_DIRS_TO_MAKE):
       CF_SRC_MODULES($modules_to_build) 
     remove the line
       test "$use_database" = yes && SUB_MAKEFILES="$SUB_MAKEFILES misc/run_tic.sh:misc/run_tic.in"

Run autoconf with version 2.52.20011227. Patch available at
  http://invisible-island.net/autoconf/

==> ncurses-fix <==
#!/bin/sh

mv aclocal.m4 aclocal.m4-$$
sed \
  -e "s/: .{BUILD_\(.*\):='\(.*\)'}/: \${BUILD_\1=\`echo '\2'\`}/" \
  -e "s/\`echo ''\`//" < aclocal.m4-$$ > aclocal.m4
rm -f aclocal.m4-$$

==> t1lib <==
Downloading:
  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/t1lib-5.0.2.tar.gz

==> teckit <==
The teckit directory contains the source of the TECkit (Text Encoding Conversion
toolkit) library and tools. See http://scripts.sil.org/teckit.

The TECkit library is needed to build xetex.

The subtrees teckit/source/teckitjni and teckit/perl_binaries have been removed
as these are not relevant to building xetex or using the basic TECkit library.
The copy of zlib source code found in the teckit tree has also been removed.

The following files have been added:

  teckit.ac
  withenable.ac (currently empty)
