+#. This file allows you to change FontForge's menu shortcuts. It is a gettext
+#.  based system, which means it is locale dependant.
+
+#. These entries are formatted as follows:
+#.  First we have the (English) name of the command as it appears in
+#.      the menu.
+#.  Then we have a "|" (which is used as a separator)
+#.  Finally we have the shortcut for the command as a textual string.
+#.
+#. If you wish to change a shortcut simply provide its textual representation
+#.  in the msgstr field. So if you want the shortcut for New Outline Window
+#.  to be Ctl+O
+#.        msgid "New Outline Window|Ctl+H"
+#.        msgstr "Ctl+O"
+#. (NOTE: You should NOT include "New Outline Window|" in your msgstr)
+#. If you wish to remove a shortcut
+#.        msgid "New Outline Window|Ctl+H"
+#.        msgstr "No Shortcut"
+#. If you wish to use a function key (or similar)
+#.        msgid "New Outline Window|Ctl+H"
+#.        msgstr "F2"
+#. or
+#.        msgid "New Outline Window|Ctl+H"
+#.        msgstr "Backspace"
+
+#. You may apply one or several modifiers to shortcuts. FontForge recognizes:
+#.   Ctl+   Shft+    Alt+   CapsLock+
+#. Some keyboards have additional modifier keys, X maps them to a flag bit in
+#.  the keyboard state mask of the XKeyEvent. If you want to use these modifiers
+#.  you need to know what that bit is. FontForge will also recognize:
+#.    Flag0x01+   Flag0x02+   Flag0x04+  Flag0x08+
+#.    Flag0x10+   Flag0x20+   Flag0x40+  Flag0x80+
+#. (I can't come up with better names than these because in general
+#.  I don't know what they are myself).
+#. The mac has two additional modifier keys: Command and Option
+#.  X never gets the Command key (or rather the X application's menubar gets
+#.  it and client programs never see it) so we can't use it.
+#.  But clients can get at the Option key and FontForge recognizes
+#.     Opt+
+
+#. So...
+#.        msgid "New Outline Window|Ctl+H"
+#.        msgstr "Ctl+Shft+Alt+Flag10+Opt+F2"
+#. would be practically untypable, but syntactically valid.
+
+#. When FF displays a shortcut in the menu it will use a similar syntax.
+#. That may not be appropriate for non-English terminals. On a French system
+#.  it might be better to show the Shift modifier as Majuscule. At the bottom of
+#.  this file are several entries which are not used to set shortcuts but are
+#.  used in displaying the shortcuts in the menu, thus
+#.      #: ../gdraw/gmenu.c:120
+#.      msgid "Shft+"
+#.      msgstr "Maj+"
+
+#. Even though not obvious from this file, it is also possible to add names for
+#.  special keys. So you could add:
+#.      msgid "Escape"
+#.      msgstr "Ã‰chappe"
+#.      msgid "Delete"
+#.      msgstr "Efface"
+#. (or whatever is appropriate for keyboards)
+#.
+#. The English names accepted are those defined under XK_MISCELLANY in
+#.  keysymdef.h of the X11 header files -- without the initial XK_
+
+
+#. I am told that the use of "|" to provide contextual information in a
+#. gettext string is non-standard. However it is documented in section
+#. 10.2.6 of http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_mono/gettext.html
+#. I need it, and I will use it.
+#.
